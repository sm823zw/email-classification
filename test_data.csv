""i would  cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says 'hi my name is spike,  honey,' "" adds mr. lockyer. houston-based enron is a major energy-trading  company. like other such firms, enron has denied wrongdoing in the california  market. mark palmer, enron's vice president for corporate communications, said mr.  lockyer's comment about mr. lay "" is so counterproductive that it doesn't  merit a response."" investigators and academics say there is abundant evidence that individual  firms have been exercising ""market power."" this term is used to denote  efforts to influence wholesale-electricity prices, such as by withholding  supplies. the california independent system operator, or iso, which manages  the state's electric transmission grid, estimates that by exercising market  power, suppliers may have added about $6.8 billion to the cost of electricity  in the state since early last year. a single firm exercising such power isn't necessarily illegal, says severin  borenstein, director of the university of california energy institute. if a  company is a large supplier in the state and ""you're not exercising market  power, you are not doing your job"" on behalf of shareholders, he says. mr. borenstein and others say that there are steps that should be taken  against suppliers. they note that under federal power law, the federal energy  regulatory commission can order refunds for wholesale prices that are above  ""just and reasonable"" levels. so far, ferc has tentatively ordered california  suppliers to make tens of millions of dollars of such refunds, as part of  that agency's ongoing inquiry into the california market. critics of the  suppliers and ferc say the refunds should be in the billions of dollars. the power industry, not surprisingly, says there is nothing to accusations of  price manipulation or collusion. executives point to a botched  state-utility-deregulation plan that relies heavily on volatile spot-market  purchases. suppliers note that over the past decade, california didn't build  enough new power plants to keep up with demand growth. the allegations of  manipulation are ""a lot of sound and fury and they won't produce anything,""  says gary ackerman, executive director of the western power trading forum, an  industry trade group. investigations aplenty in the year since california's energy deregulation plan began resulting in  higher prices and even blackouts, a flurry of investigations has gotten under  way. here are the main ones: federal energy regulatory commission ????whether generators are charging more  than ""just and reasonable"" rates as demanded by the federal power act;  whether el paso corp. used its position as a major natural-gas supplier to  the state to illegally drive up the price of fuel used to generate  electricity.  california public utilities commission and the state attorney general  ????whether generators and power traders have acted illegally through  collusion or other means to artificially inflate electricity prices.  puc and california independent system operator ????whether generation plants  were shut down for spurious reasons in order to create supply shortages and,  thus, to raise electricity prices.  california electricity oversight board ????whether patterns of bidding and  pricing in california's electricity auction indicate collusive or otherwise  illegal behavior.  sources: state and federal agencies power generators also point to sharp increases in some of their costs,  particularly natural gas, which is a major power-plant fuel. this rise in  natural-gas prices also has set off a flurry of investigations over possible  of probes by federal and state officials. el paso denies any wrongdoing. while power-industry officials say they have been cooperating with the  investigations, law-enforcement officials say they have hit some roadblocks.  for instance, mr. lockyer's office has gone to san francisco state court to  enforce subpoenas against reliant, houston-based dynegy inc. and southern co.  and mirant corp., both of atlanta, after the companies resisted turning over  certain business documents they deemed confidential. investigators have zeroed in on the increased frequency with which plants are  going out of service for unscheduled outages. at times, several thousand  fewer megawatts of capacity are available than a year ago. a thousand  megawatts can power about one million homes. 'forced outage' rate rises generators say that this increased ""forced outage"" rate shows that tight  supplies over the past year have required them to run plants, some of them  more than 40 years old, for long periods without routine maintenance. this  combination has produced more breakdowns. ""plants have been running flat  out,"" says tom williams, a spokesman for duke energy co., charlotte, n.c.,  which says that its california power plants produced 50% more electricity in  at the same time, during periods of lower demand, the number of unplanned  outages often seems to rise enough to keep supplies tight, says frank wolak,  a stanford university professor and chairman of the iso's market surveillance  committee. ""clearly, something is going on here."" however, he and others say  that it is almost impossible to tell why a particular pipe failed or whether  such a failure was a legitimate reason to reduce output. some of the most intriguing evidence to date about forced outages surfaced in  a federal case. ferc officials said an investigation had raised questions  about whether two major power companies had taken plants out of service in  order to reap higher electricity prices. the charges against aes corp.,  arlington, va., which owns the plants, and williams cos., tulsa, okla., which  markets their output, asserted that those actions allowed the companies to  in one instance, according to case filings, a williams employee ""indicated""  to aes officials that his firm wouldn't financially penalize aes for  extending an outage at one plant. this conversation, which was voluntarily  divulged by williams, could be an indication of collusion. williams and aes  settled the case without admitting any wrongdoing by paying back $8 million  to the iso and by taking certain other measures. a williams spokeswoman says  the employee who talked to aes was ""counseled not to enter into any  conversations of that nature"" in the future. another issue raised by the ferc case touched on maintenance procedures.  according to the filings, aes stopped doing a certain procedure to keep its  plant's cooling system from getting clogged. the clogging of the system was  cited as a reason for one of the forced outages. mark woodruff, president of  the aes unit that operates the plant in question, says the company  substituted what it felt was an equally effective maintenance procedure. if someone was looking to keep supplies tight and prices high, changes in  maintenance procedures would be an easy way to ensure that plants,  particularly old ones, have frequent forced outages, says a senior  utility-industry executive. by restricting maintenance resources, he says, an  operator can simply allow a plant ""to take itself out of service."" write to john r. emshwiller at  copyright 2001 knight ridder/tribune news service section: state and regional news headline:

""they couldn't take notes from my lecture because they didn't understand the vocabulary. that bothers me a lot. who's going to inherit this country?"" ??seay, who recently moved to los angeles from miami, said he is troubled by the air pollution and racial tension he has encountered here. seay is african american and his wife is italian, he said, and their 9-year-old daughter is ""stuck half-and-half,"" caught in what seay regards as a troubling black-white divide.

edison has six in central and southern california.  ??the puc then finds the average amount of electricity use for customers  within each region. the baseline quantity is 50 percent to 60 percent of that amount, and up to 70 percent of that amount during the winter months if a customer  uses only one type of energy (electricity or natural gas). ??customers who depend on electronic medical equipment such as suction, breathing and dialysis machines, can apply for a slightly higher baseline. ??a family living in the scorching hot coachella valley would have a larger allotment of lower-priced electricity than a family living in breezy monterey, given that air conditioning for the former is necessary to survival. ??since baseline is based on averages, a single apartment dweller and a family of four who live in the same region could have the same baseline. that makes  it more likely for the family to get hit with rate hikes and less likely, economists fear, that the apartment dweller has a financial incentive to conserve. ??""where it is imperfect is that it has no ability to make any adjustments for the size of the family,"" said john nelson, a pg&e spokesman. ??focusing baseline on household size gets complicated, florio said. ""does  ??along with raising $5.7 billion to replenish the state's general fund for power buys since january, the rate hikes approved march 27 by the puc and allocated on tuesday were also meant to trigger conservation that could help avoid rolling blackouts this summer. loretta lynch and fellow commissioner wood say they may hold hearings as early as this coming week on possible inequities and ways to update the system. ??""there was plenty of testimony at public hearings that people suspect that baselines are not appropriate or are not calculated right,"" wood said. ??wood said when baseline first was created nearly 20 years ago, houses were smaller and many lacked central air conditioning. ??though the puc has updated baseline amounts through the years, ""living standards have changed, housing standards have changed and it may be that average usage is different from what it was,"" wood said. ??florio said giving baselines a second look could go either way for  consumers. there are typically more electronic gadgets in homes these days, but many of those gadgets and appliances are more energy efficient than their ancestors. ??add that to increased conservation statewide, florio said, and there's a  slim chance baselines could actually go down and expose more customers to rate  hikes. ??""it's a percentage of average use historically, and people have used energy more efficiently,"" through the years, florio said. ??california public utilities commission: http://www.cpuc.ca.gov ??pacific gas and electric co.: http://www.pge.com ??southern california edison co.: http://www.sce.com the materials in the ap file were compiled by the associated press. ?these materials may not be republished without the express written consent of the associated press. section: state and regional headline: new poll suggests californians haven't been this gloomy for years dateline: san francisco body: in the wrong direction. economy to worsen in the next year, while about 40 percent see a brighter horizon, according to a new poll. early may by the nonpartisan public policy institute of california. the poll  was conducted in english and spanish. ??the twin culprits were the souring economy and the electricity crisis. ??""californians clearly see the electricity crisis as a harbinger of other growth-related problems,"" said mark baldassare, the research institute's  survey director.

??with three power plants down for repairs last week when temperatures spiked, large customers in eastern iowa were notified their electricity would be cut off. headlines proclaimed a ""crisis,"" and legislative leaders shifted into an  told you so"" mode. ??this is not california. there is no crisis. customers with interruptible consumption or when generators are down. ??it may not be fair to suggest that alliant energy chose to idle three of its biggest generators to make the case for changing the law, but the timing is nonetheless convenient. the legislature is set to convene a special session  few weeks, and among the business left over from the regular session could be  a bill to make it easier for power companies to build electric generating  plants. ??while crisis is not imminent, iowa does face the prospect of consuming more electricity than the state's utilities are able to generate themselves. ... a special session, that should not be the end of the matter. ultimately, the legislature must fashion a long-range energy policy for this state that takes  a regional view of energy, that reflects new market and regulation realities,  and that seizes the potential for conservation and renewable alternatives to  fossil fuels. ??legislative session: ??telegraph herald does it always seem the big-ticket items are pushed through in the final days? ??this year's session started out strong, passing a bill to save taxpayers money by eliminating the sales tax on residential utility bills. it finished  up by coming through with $40 million for teachers' pay. there was plenty of hand-wringing about the budget shortfall, the usual banter about dove hunting and a fair amount of partisan bickering. ... open records law. the way it stands now, a governmental body can use a private contractor to investigate problems within the department and keep that contractor's report confidential under the law's whistle-blower provision. ... ??-the legislature didn't want to get into a full-blown gambling debate, so it didn't address a tax freeze at racetracks. ... the issue of fairness needs to  be addressed. ??floating casinos pay a 20 percent tax, while racetracks pay a gradually ??-other things that legislators talked about but didn't get around to  include: cutting state income tax on social security income and a pair of bills addressing the state's bottle-deposit law. jobs ??-amend the open records law. allowing agencies to keep information about government activities secret simply because it is in the possession of an outside contractor is a hole in the law that needs to be fixed. will have been a waste if the program is left hanging unfunded. ??-freeze the amount of tax racetracks pay where it stands and stop the hemorrhaging of dollars into state coffers. the disparity between racetracks  and riverboat casinos needs to be righted. ??and if they're worried that the discussion will draw an all-out gambling debate, lawmakers might want to bring it to the table before may. ??we agree with gov. tom vilsack that the new state budget approved by legislators ""will cause hardship for people and families across our state."" don't have as much money as you wanted. ??on the contrary, vilsack got what he said all along would be the high mark  of pay. ??and the republican-led legislature also agreed to phase out the sales tax on utilities, long a goal of vilsack's democratic party. ??is it the best we likely can do under the circumstances? yes. ??vilsack should sign budget legislation, rather than vetoing it and calling a special session of the legislature this summer. ... ??plant sciences institute: ??des moines register: ??iowa needs more people, especially young people. iowa needs more jobs that pay well - the kinds of jobs that cause other businesses, small and large, to spring up here. so why did iowa lawmakers blow the single best opportunity for both? ??they blame it on a tight budget. blame them for failing to grasp the big picture. the fledgling plant sciences institute at iowa state university could become a major force in the fast-growing field of biotechnology related to agriculture - yet the 2001 legislature provided no new money. million, a meager increase proposed by the governor. it allowed isu to keep money from the sale of land, with proceeds to be used for the institute's roy  j. million in cash. ... ??because of legislative inaction, promising initiatives must slow down, or  may never take place. ... ??the institute had hoped to hire another top researcher in the field of corn genomics ... ??ag-biotech companies have been appealing to the state for help putting together a protein-extraction facility ... such a facility might extract  protein from conventional or genetically modified plants for such uses as pharmaceuticals, food additives or chemical enzymes for industrial processes. the plant sciences institute has a small, pilot protein-extraction facility.  new money from the legislature would have allowed it to assist businesses in establishing a commercial facility. but now? ""the people interested in this  will probably go elsewhere,"" said director stephen howell. ??why wouldn't they? plenty of other states are serious about fostering  biotech industries. the iowa commitment is hardly encouraging. ... ??iowa has a budget crunch because its economy and population are not growing fast enough. investing in biotechnology - the technology that is expected to drive the next great wave of economic growth - is the most promising way to  make iowa's economy and population grow. stinting on that investment is stunningly shortsighted. ??ten million dollars next session should not be out of the question. the question should be what sort of future will iowa have if it does not make the most of the potential the plant sciences institute holds. ??hunting requirements: ??in april, the iowa house and senate rejected a measure that would have required wild turkey hunters to report their harvest to the department of natural resources, saying it was ""just another hassle,"" for hunters. percent. a non-resident who wants to hunt deer in iowa under this plan will  have to shell out $308, including a hunting license and habitat fee. the current we don't much care about managing our wildlife and we don't want you here,  either. add to the mix a federal whammy in the freedom to farm act, which has all but eliminated any fence rows, and hunting as a potential tourism draw to iowa  blows away in the wind. ... ??instead of having accurate information on how much hunting is affecting turkey populations, department of natural resources wildlife managers are now left to guess. ... ??surrounding states which capitalize on their resources require even more harvest registration, and it hasn't slowed interest. ... ??the dnr asked for the fee increases for good reasons - license fees have not increased for a decade while the costs of salaries, travel and equipment have begun to eat into funds available for facilities and land acquisition. and  we're in favor of using fees to support wildlife management. is ??but some fee hikes were too much. ??in particular, the non-resident fees for deer hunting are high especially in comparison to surrounding states, and are more than most ordinary people are likely to pay. wisconsin charges non-residents $135 to hunt deer. missouri in, not more. what out-of-state hunter will be drawn to iowa when surrounding  states are managing their herds better and charging less to visit? ??iowa worries that the farm economy is in the tank. we wring our hands as our young people rush to other parts of the country. we say that our natural resources here can be an attraction that will draw people back. yet these  votes run counter to sound wildlife management and increased tourism. ??public official recruits: ??more iowa school districts and local governments are using professional companies to help find high-level administrators such as superintendents, but that recruiting tool is making the process less accountable to the public. ??in effect, it allows private firms to dictate public policy, and that's troubling. ??one example of this trend is the camanche school district, where six finalists for the superintendents job were in town for interviews recently.  they met with school board members, district staff and some residents, yet the  board does not intend to reveal the names of the candidates. the cedar rapids headhunter firm that has contracted with the district advised the school board not to announce the names. ??headhunters also are advising candidates to request their names be kept confidential. under iowa law, a public entity such as a school board must  honor such a request. ??some public officials justify this secrecy by arguing that finalists don't want the public to know if they didn't get the job offer or worry that identification may jeopardize their current position. ... ??those arguments aren't justified, for reasons including: ??-there is nothing dishonorable in not being chosen for a top-level post. indeed, being considered a finalist for such a job may serve only to enhance a candidates attractiveness for another position ... ??-identifying the finalists for the public also allows citizens to ask questions and provide other information, critical or supportive, that could be useful in helping officials make a final choice. ??-and being upfront with the public lends credibility to the entire process ... ??we prefer a process similar to one used by the city of clinton during its recent search for a city administrator. the five finalists were not only identified, they took part in an open house to meet the public. a headhunter firm was used, but city attorney bruce johansen, himself a candidate who did  not get the job, said he made it clear to the agency that the finalists names  should be made public. ??we applaud that effort ... ??meanwhile, the iowa legislature this spring modified a state law that has been the basis of confidentiality claims for candidates seeking public positions. the change would require that official communication between  private contractors and the public entities they serve be open to public inspection. whether that law will be interpreted to include headhunter firms remains to be seen. ... ??we encourage school boards and local governments to resist confidentiality and test the new law when it takes effect july 1. ??cedar rapids gazette: ??who'd have thought that the selection of the secretary of the federal department of human services last winter might affect whether davenport, iowa city and des moines get rail service. ??but consider that hhs secretary tommy thompson, who resigned recently from the amtrak board, had been a strong advocate of expanded rail service here in the midwest while he was governor of wisconsin. thompson had hoped to remain chairman of the amtrak board after he went to washington. but the associated press reports that a 1997 law that restructured the amtrak board says only one administration wants transportation secretary norman mineta on the governing board. ??few people around are as passionate as thompson about amtrak, and iowa could have benefited. it's hard to ride a national passenger train service that doesn't go where the majority of iowans live. maybe the service will be  expanded here. but maybe, with the changes in the governing board, that train has  already left the station. ??smoker identification: ??have you heard the news from walgreen's? they're going to card everybody who wants to buy a package of cigarettes, a box of cigars, a can of chew. ??that can't have been an easy decision. within a year, they're looking at software that will require clerk's to enter a customer's birth date into a computer before a tobacco sale can be completed. until then, they're asking their clerks to card everybody. good for them. ... ??yes, it will take a little extra time ... evidently, the owners/corporate bigwigs think the time is well spent if it eliminates the fines and bad publicity. ??a convenience store association spokesman told reporters that other stores are likely to duplicate walgreen's efforts. yes. we certainly hope so. ??we all have heard terrible numbers of deaths caused by tobacco, of underage users ... many, if not most of us, know someone who hacks and coughs, who died from smoking, who cries because someone died from smoking. when you think of them, it doesn't seem so outrageous to card everyone. it seems downright brilliant. ... ??it won't stop it entirely. young wanna-be-smokers will have somebody older  do the buying, or swipe a carton. there will always be a way to get around it, there always is. ??still, carding everyone says, ""this is important, we mean it and we're not going to make it easy for you."" content and programming copyright 2001 cnbc/dow jones business video, a  division ??of cnbc/dow jones desktop video, llc. no portions of the

section: business guests: robert glynn byline: mark haines, joe battipaglia may be updated. mark haines, cnbc anchor, squawk box: one company that is hurting a lot in all this is pg&e, the parent of pacific gas and electric. they filed for chapter  bankruptcy in april. pg&e has about $9 billion in unrecovered power costs. a california bankruptcy judge says the company cannot raise retail rates to  recoup those losses. the stock is on a steep decline this year, trading in the 52  week joining us to tell us where things are now and where they could be going, robert glynn, pg&e's chairman and ceo. mr. glynn, good to see you again. robert glynn, chairman & ceo, pg&e: good morning, mark. glynn: well, we're working our way through the federal bankruptcy proceeding, where we affirmatively stepped in order to resolve issues between ourselves  and our creditors. we have a plan of reorganization under development and we're getting close to the time when we can begin to share that plan with the creditors who, after all, need to get paid. haines: so let's first talk about time. how much time do you think this might take before pg&e emerges from bankruptcy? glynn: well, it's very hard to tell for one reason. there have not been very many utility bankruptcies and i don't know of any that has had these complexities to it. the shortest possible time or shortest likely time that  heard about has been six to eight months and that's probably shorter than it will take. the longest that i've heard about is about four years and that's an awful lot longer than i want it to take. haines: in the meantime you are selling electricity, transmitting and selling electricity on a retail level. are you still losing money on your operating? glynn: well, the potential area for continuing loss exposure is the issue of whether the california independent system operator is still buying on behalf  of our company instead of buying directly on behalf of our customers. and that's  an issue that's before the federal energy regulatory commission for decision  making right now. haines: well, i guess my question is who is paying the bills right now? glynn: well, the electric rates in california have just been raised by the california public utilities commission in order to have the state, the department of water resources be able to recover all of its costs because  that's what, of course, it wants to do. it doesn't want to go any deeper in debt than it has to. so this most recent large rate increase has applied, as best as we can tell, exclusively to cover the state's cost increases and not to cover  some of the ones that we're responsible for. joe battipaglia: mr. glynn, the brownouts continue in california. what's the status of supply of electricity into the state, putting aside for a moment how glynn: well, the california electricity crisis at its heart is a supply shortage and the outlook for this summer and next summer are pretty bleak.  every responsible entity that has reviewed the situation is forecasting that there will be a large number of rolling blackouts occurring over the summer of 2001 around. battipaglia: does that spread from california to other states as the draw down becomes perilous? glynn: well, the california electricity market and the pacific northwest markets have had a very nice symbiotic relationship over many, many years shipping power back and forth to one another. that has been interrupted  because of the supply shortage in california, which means that california is trying to be a net importer all the time. and it seems like the pacific northwest won't have the kind of surplus energy to send south to california that it's had in  the past. haines: does this ultimately end with retail electricity distribution transmission and distribution being done by a state authority and no longer by privately held or publicly held companies? glynn: i don't think it ends there at all, mark. and i certainly don't think that it's in the state's interest to try to get into businesses that can be  done by private capital when the state has so many other important things to use  its capital on, like education and infrastructure. and i do think that this supply shortage has got to be resolved. it's got to be resolved by building new  supply. there's simply no alternative to that and that's going to take another couple  of years before that new construction is fully completed. haines: all right, sir. thank you very much for the update. we appreciate it. robber glynn, pg&e's chairman and ceo. end section: news; domestic

?it recommends that israel resume paying the money that's collected in taxes back to the palestinian authority. ?it recommends a whole range of action, many of them to be taken by israel, which the reports says would help bring the tone back to where it  needs to be, would help bring the two sides back to where they could once again be negotiating instead of shooting at each other and letting off bombs. however, for him to get involved in shuttle diplomacy. ?he wants first to have ambassador burns and the others come up with recommendations over the next  week, two weeks or three, and then he and the president will try to figure out where the u.s. can go from here. middle east. ?they are now engaging somewhat, because they're so concerned about the situation out there, judy. ??woodruff: david, the report, the mitchell report, suggesting that the israelis more responsible here, or at least that they have more to do in order to get things back on the peace track than the palestinians? ensor: the report is very even-handed. ?it doesn't blame either side for the situation. ?it, for example, does not blame ariel sharon's visit to the temple mount for the following intifada, intifada ii it's been called. ?but it says that there  needs to be a series of actions by both sides to bring down the tensions, and if you look at the list of what it's asking for, there are more steps that the  israelis would have to take than the palestinians. ??woodruff: and david, why is it that the administration is saying at this in an energetically involved way the way the clinton administration was? ??ensor: well, i think the administration, this administration, feels that the thing a little bit. ?it was too much presidential involvement and it was too much of a day-to-day hand-holding operation. ?they feel they need to hold back a little bit and try to get the parties to talk to each other. ??however, the situation is deteriorating pretty rapidly, and so now they realize they have to have some greater involvement. ?and that's why ambassador burns has been asked to prepare these recommendation, judy. ??woodruff: all right. ?david ensor reporting for us from the state  department. ??for more on the middle east conflict, stay with us for a special half-hour ??now, we turn to questions about the bush administration's political fund-raising tactics. ?tonight, vice president dick cheney is scheduled to  host spokeswoman for the democrats says that that event smacks of, in her words, hypocrisy. ??the democrats say the reception at the vice president's home is comparable  to clinton-era events, such as white house coffees and lincoln bedroom sleepovers for big donors, which drew heavy criticism from republicans. ?among them: presidential candidate george w. bush. oval office desk to the buck stops here on the lincoln bedroom. ?and that's not  good conduct ourselves in office. there's a huge trust. ?i see it all the time when ??and we can do better than the past administration has done. ??woodruff: despite that sort of criticism then, the republicans are defending their fund-raising tactics now. ?senate majority leader trent lott had this to say about the reception for big donors at vice president cheney's home  tonight. there's any question, i'd suggest you address it to them. ?unfortunately, i voting, giving tax relief. ??woodruff: virtually all of those gop contributors, who will mingle with vice republican national committee. ?they will also attend a major rnc fund-raiser tomorrow night that features president bush as the main speaker and is  expected ??now let's bring in our white house correspondent, major garrett. ??major, tell us about what this event is about tomorrow night. ??major garrett, cnn correspondent: well, it's the first official republican national committee event to honor the president and the first lady, as you  said. the targeted haul is $15 million. republican national committee officials tell republican party has held for years and years in washington. ??as for what's happening in the vice president's residence tonight, white house press secretary ari fleischer told me this is a way of saying ""thank  you,"" in his words, ""to those republicans who,"" as ari fleischer said, ""did so much  to help win the selection."" ??and he draws a distinction with the clinton-era coffees and sleepovers, describing them as, quote, ""organized schemes to bring people through the  gates of the white house to get money or to persuade others to do so."" ??mark minor, who is the communications director for the republican national committee, also said that no one paid to go to the vice president's residence. no checks will pass between hands there. there is no quid pro quo, and that  some people who will be at the vice president's residence tonight are not in fact  rnc ??woodruff: so, major, again, clarify the distinction between money events  that are given as a thank you and events that are given as an encouragement to give more money. ??garrett: well, it's a distinction this white house wants to draw as clearly as it possibly can. ?in the words of ari fleischer, thanking someone, whether it's on government property or not on government property, is a completely legitimate activity for the president or the vice president to engage in. ?the distinction he is drawing is that during the clinton era people were brought  to the white house, to these coffees, and as was disclosed in the thompson report that was conducted by the senate investigating that, there was some evidence  of actually targeted lists: that people who were brought in, money was described  to bringing in for a coffee. ?a certain dollar amount was attached to donations  to the democratic national committee, a larger amount if they, in fact, slept  here at the white house in the lincoln bedroom. ?that is the key distinction, the republicans say: that there is no targeting necessarily of these people to  come to the vice president's residence. ??they also point out that the original letters inviting these big donors to washington did not in any way suggest there would be a reception at the vice president's residence: the point there being these people donated without any expectation of having dinner or reception with lynne cheney and dick cheney in the vice president's home. vice president's, how many are they saying did not give money? ??garrett: they're not disclosing any numbers. ?they're only saying that some have given. ?they clearly and readily acknowledge that. ?some are lobbyists. some represent large corporations. ?but others, they say, are just republican don't have any numbers for you on that, though. ??woodruff: all right, major garrett reporting at the white house. thank you very much. ??vice president cheney maybe taking some heat for fund-raising tactics, not  to mention his role in creating the bush energy plan. look that this: ??our new poll shows cheney's job approval rating is 4 points higher than the presidents. ?while mr. bush's approval rating has held pretty steady in the  past couple of weeks, he has lost ground since late april. ?cheney's approval  rating has dipped as well. ??for more on mr. bush's ratings and how they relate to his policies, we are joined now by our senior political analyst bill schneider. ??tell us, bill, which of mr. bush's policies is the most popular? ??william schneider, cnn senior political analyst: well, you might guess you would be wrong. ??because, what americans like best is the tax cut. ?two thirds of the public now favors a substantial tax cut. ?that's up from 60 percent earlier this  month. well, why not? ?what's wrong with getting some money back from the government? ??actually, most people do not think the tax cut could benefit them much financially. ?they like it because they believe it will help the economy. ?and that is why so many democrats find it very difficult to oppose. actually divided over the president's energy plan. ?why? ?it's not because the public blames the bush administration for the nation's energy problems. ?most people blame the oil companies. ??in fact, more people blame congress and the clinton administration and environmental laws and american consumers than blame the bush administration. but most americans still give president bush low marks on energy. ?the core americans say president bush is not doing enough to solve the country's energy problems. americans believe the plan will help the nation's energy problem immediately. most people think oh, it will help, but only after several years. ?it's a long-run solution. ?americans want help now. ?right now. ?with electricity in california. ?and with gas prices all over the country. ?long-term solutions  are important, but politics is a short-term business. ?if the problem is now,  people want results now. gasoline now. ??schneider: because they think this administration is run by oilmen. ?oilmen ??by nearly two to one, the public believes energy companies have too much influence over the bush administration's policies. ?in fact, americans are  split when you ask them whether the bush energy plan is designed to further the country's interests or the energy companies' interests. ?that sounds like breathtaking cynicism. ?but any administration that's run by texas oilmen is automatically suspect. ??woodruff: all right, bill schneider, thank you very much. you're not  suspect. ??schneider: i am certainly not. ??do californians blame president bush for their energy crisis? we've heard a little bit from bill on that. ?that answer and more on the issue later this ??just what kind of tax cut is the senate considering? ?jonathan karl crunches the numbers. ?also: ??unidentified male: we have no ability to bring up the amendments. ?you don't set the agenda every day, and that is real power in the house. ??woodruff: the trials and tribulations of the minority leader, as he  considers the present and the future. ?and later: ??rewarding a president's most controversial decision. ?a political ""profile  in courage."" all ahead on inside politics. ??woodruff: president bush today donned the traditional commencement robes,  and gave the graduating class at yale university a few bits of advice. ?the president also included a glimpse at his less-than-perfect college years. ?as cnn's kelly wallace reports, today's speech was a departure from how the president's dealt with his alma mater in the past. ??kelly wallace, cnn white house correspondent (voice-over): a homecoming of sorts, george w. bush who has only been back to his alma mater once since yale's graduating class. ??i say, you too, can be president of the united states. ??wallace: the president offering a self-deprecating account of his days as  the undergraduate, when, as a history major, he earned modest grades and was known more as a fraternity boy prankster than a rising political star. ??the visit was not without controversy, with some students protesting and  some professors boycotting, charging that mr. bush was not yet deserving of an honorary degree. ??peter brooks, yale university professor: it doesn't seem at present to represent the intellectual ideals and the service to humanity in which we  think that yale stands for. ??wallace: the president has kept his distance from this ivy league  institution for most of his political life, painting it as a symbol of elitism, even  during respond well to are people who are snobs, whether you are a social snob or an intellectual snob or any other kind of snob. ??wallace: mr. bush rarely mentions what he did on this day, that he was born in new haven when his dad, the former president, was an undergraduate at yale. texas. ?from there, yale always seemed a world away. ??wallace: the president, for years, had been miffed with yale for not  awarding it appears now, all is forgiven. current student, seems very proud that yale is a part of his past. ??kelly wallace, cnn, new haven, connecticut. he will explore seeking the democratic presidential nomination. ?the civil rights activist said yesterday that the party did not protect the rights of disenfranchised voters in florida in the last presidential race. ??if he runs, sharpton said that he would promote issues that concern blacks and progressives, and his effort would not be just symbolic. ?sharpton ran city ??reverend sharpton and former republican presidential candidate gary bauer will discuss president bush's faith-based plan to help the poor tonight on ??another note from new york: a state supreme court justice today barred rudy giuliani's girlfriend from the mayor's official residence, gracie mansion.  judge ruled in favor of giuliani's estranged wife, donna hanover, who had requested a restraining order barring judith nathan from the residence. ?the ruling says that nathan may not enter the residence as long as the giuliani children continue to live there. ?the judge also denied giuliani's second attempt for a gag order in the couple's divorce proceedings. ??and we'll have the latest on president bush's tax cut when we come back. ??(commercial break) woodruff: this evening, the senate is expected to vote on the latest version of the now $1.35 trillion tax cut plan. ?republican leaders hope to give president bush the tax cut for approval before memorial day. ?but as jonathan karl reports, taxpayers will have a longer wait before reaping any of the measure's benefits. ??jonathan karl, cnn congressional correspondent (voice-over): the senate's your tax windfall yet. ?most of the cuts will not take effect for several  years to come. bush is re-elected, it wouldn't take effect until two years after he completed his increasing the ??sen. charles grassley (r-ia), finance committee chairman: you are right,  some relief to wait until next year. couples filing jointly, but just how that money gets back to taxpayers is  still to be worked out. ?the option favored by the president is a simple rebate  check sent directly to taxpayers, an idea opposed by many senate republicans who  call it impractical. ??but the rebate would represent a fraction of the overall tax cut, which democratic opponents say will explode in cost after it's fully phased in two years from now. means simply that it is disguised in terms of its full cost. ?this decade it trillion. ??karl: but there's a little noticed provision of this tax cut that may make that point moot. ?the tax cut includes a sunset provision, that means all the remain in place, congress would have to pass them again. ??karl: now, the senate is expected to vote on a series of amendments to the tax cut later on today, paving the way for a final vote on the tax cut here in the senate tonight. ?but it will not end there. ?this still needs to be reconciled with the tax cut that was passed in house, the house passing almost exactly the president's tax cut, including much deeper cuts in income tax  rates preferred by republicans. ??the senate and the house will have to work out their differences. they're expected to do so this week, setting the stage to send this final tax cut down the president was talking about when he said the tax cut would help people  with higher gasoline prices? talking about, directing the money right into the hands of taxpayers, directly into the hands of those people paying higher gasoline prices at the pumps. ??this is an idea that his treasury secretary, paul o'neill, strongly favors, the idea of direct cash payments or check payments to taxpayers. ?but one big problem with this, judy, is that taxpayers over the course of time move, they change addresses, some of them die. the question is, how do you make sure you get all the right checks to those people at current addresses? ?it's not an  easy proposition. solicitor general of the united states has run into a real problem in the  senate committee. ?where does that stand right now? ?the last we heard, the senate judiciary had split 9-9 on the nomination of ted olson. ??karl: well, the senate leaders, trent lott and tom daschle, are now actively involved in this, trying to come to some kind of an agreement, an agreement  that will allow the democrats to get access to some information they want about olson, especially information that was compiled by independent council robert ray, looking to just what olson's involvement was in that arkansas project by the ""american spectator"" magazine, the investigation into bill clinton's personal life. ??they want information from the independent council to look at just how involved olson was in that project, to see whether or not he was truthful in  his testimony when he said he was not very involved at all. ?there's some movement to try to get the democrats on the committee more of the information, also  maybe to release more of it to the public. nomination before the full senate, but probably not until after memorial day. ?the senate goes on recess at the end of the week, they will be off all of next week, you probably won't see a vote on the olson nomination until after they return. ??woodruff: all right, jon karl at the capitol, thanks. in the house of representatives, democrats are finding themselves drowned out by the  republican majority. ?add to that, critics who say the party is lacking leadership and strategy. ?and life in the house minority begins to look bleak. ?our kate snow caught up with the house minority leader dick gephardt to talk about the  balance of power and his political future. for, and that's what... ??kate snow, cnn congressional correspondent (voice-over): dick gephardt will tell you it's frustrating being a democrat these days, stuck in the minority without the backing of the white house. hard as you can, and if you really believe in it, then you're frustrated if you're not able to those policies through. ??snow: gephardt says the democrats are forced to play defense, responding to republicans. deficits out there in the future won't be so large. ?i think we cooperated with the president on the educational bill, at least the substance of it, but we still haven't been able to convince him or the republicans to put enough money into education to really make the program happen. ??on energy, i think that we've got a very, very positive alternative that i hope people will listen to. ?people in california and oregon and washington  need help now. capitol the next day, and then in a underground war room. ??gephardt is a master at staying on message, often spending hours talking to the press, his strategy: agree with republicans when he thinks they're right  and hammer at home when he disagrees. is a mistake that we will pay for for years to come. there are times when you need to show your emotion. ?you need to let people  know that you really care about this. ?and you really want the country to go in a different direction. ?and i think you can't appear too tentative or too laid back or too uninterested. ??i have talked to some democrats who say that they are truly unhappy. some of whom say that they are unhappy with your leadership. ?they don't feel that you're doing an effective job. ?do you feel that there is trouble within the ranks? party are largely unified. ?they are marching together and working together in we. ??i would never tell you that anybody is ever going to be pleased every day with everything that happens, but largely, i think that we've achieved real unity and real effectiveness in being the loyal opposition here in washington. election? important, not for the party and not for me, but for the country. legislatively for the next couple of years? really out of power totally in the house. ?you have no ability to bring up  amendments, you don't set the agenda every day. and that is real power in the house. do you have plans to run for president? ??gephardt: i really think that if you don't stay totally focused on the goal that is ahead of you, then you lessen your chances of reaching that goal. ?and usual in our system, we all want to look ahead and start calling the next race after that for president, but that is not what i'm doing and not what i should be doing. ??snow (voice-over): gephardt insists he's not planning ahead, though he's scheduled to attend four events in new hampshire in two weeks. ??gephardt: the future will take of itself. ?i have no idea what will happen, and i'm not worried about it, and i don't spend time worrying about it. ??gephardt: absolutely. ?i'm totally committed to winning this house back, and ??woodruff: kate snow talking with house minority leader dick gephardt. ?they talked today. ?and later this week, kate will sit down with house speaker  dennis hastert. ?you can look for that report on friday. ??on another term for the another high-profile republican and two nationally known democrats with apparent home state ambitions. ??inside politics will be right back. ??to no one's surprise, charlton heston was reelected today to an  unprecedented fourth term as president of the national rifle association. ?the 77-year-old actor was chosen at the nra's annual convention in kansas city. ?the group changed its rules last year to allow heston a third term, and a spokesman said there really wasn't much discussion by the board before deciding to elect him, once again. ??former attorney general janet reno may be looking for a new line of work. now back in her native florida, reno says she finds the idea of running for governor appealing. ??janet reno, former attorney general: i love florida very much. i was born  and that i do everything i can, either as governor or otherwise, to serve the interest  of the people of florida. ??woodruff: reno says she does not believe that her parkinson's disease would keep her from running, and she expects to make a decision before the end of  the year. ??governor jeb bush says possible opponents do not factor into his decision on whether to run for reelection. ??house minority whip david bonior may trade in his congressional seat for a run at the governor's mansion. ?the 13-term congressman from michigan filed  his aides say that a formal announcement will come later. ?with michigan slated to lose one house district, bonior's seat may be vulnerable to the state's republican controlled redistricting efforts. ?republican governor john engler cannot seek reelection because of term limits. ??californians and the energy crunch: are they pointing fingers at the president? ?we'll check new poll numbers from the golden state, and discuss power politics in the state when we return. californians say they disapprove of the way president bush is handling that state's power woes, according to a new poll. ?but the survey shows more californians are placing blame for the problem on utility companies, former governor pete  wilson and current governor gray davis than on president bush and the federal government. ?the democrats are trying hard to convince californians that republicans should be held accountable for the power problem. ?here is a democratic congressional campaign committee ad that begins airing in los  angeles today. ??narrator: california's energy crisis is deepening, with summer blackouts predicted and rate hikes of up to 80 percent. yet president bush has offered  no relief to hard-pressed rate payers. ?his spokesman saying, ""the president continues to believe that the issue is mostly a california matter"" and our representative, stephen horn, has joined with bush in opposing a temporary cap on electricity prices. ?call congressman horn and tell him we need action now. ??woodruff: the democratic committee said that it has bought significant air time for that spot, part of a month-long radio and tv ad campaign targeting republicans on energy. ?let's talk more now about energy politics with the director of that public policy institute of california poll we just told you about, mark baldassare joins us now from san francisco. ??mark, first of all, this poll finds californians pessimistic in general, did that surprise you? ??mark baldassare, california pollster: it did. ?for the past three years, we've been in an incredible time of optimism in california. ?two-thirds of californians have said that the state is going in the right direction. ?most californians felt that economic times would continue to be good, and most californians also were highly approving of the governor and the legislature. for the first time, we've seen a dramatic drop in optimism about the state, about the economy and ratings of the governor. ??baldassare: well, eight in ten californians say they have been closely following the electricity situation in the state and most californians are telling us in our survey that they consider it the top issue and 80 percent of californians say it's a big problem and moreover, a problem that is going to effect the economy. ?so there's been a great deal of uncertainty that's been created by the electricity situation and because of that uncertainty, people  are beginning to feel very nervous about our state. ??woodruff: so you're saying because of the electricity crisis, if you want to call it that in california, it's now driving people's views of everything: population, the economy, across-the-board. improving the schools, for instance. ?now only 6 percent in our most recent survey said that's the issue that concerns them most in the state. ?and we see that there is growing pessimism at the same time that there is growing concern that this electricity situation is not under control and could affect the state's economy. schneider reported earlier on the program that americans, overall, are having mixed views about to what extent president bush is responsible. ?here we're learning in california, they hold president bush far less responsible than  they do local leaders. ??baldassare: yeah, well, we are at time right now in california where people haven't experienced the rate hikes yet. ?they've certainly heard about them. they haven't experienced, for the most part, frequent rolling blackouts, but they hear that they're coming. and so when we talk about blame, people are focused on what happened five years ago to put us into this situation. ?and  for that, of course, they don't blame either the current governor or the current president. ?now, as we go forward over the next few months, people are going  to be re-assigning blame as well as re-evaluating the solutions that are in  place, and that's why i think both the democrats and republicans are very urgently trying to get their message out right now about who they think is to blame and who they think has the best solutions. we just saw the democrats running out there, are those likely to have an  effect on people's views? a effect on people's views over these next few months is how the crisis is actually resolved. ?and if people feel that these electricity hikes have  really, you know, altered their lifestyle or they're going to impact the economy, if they feel blackouts are really going to, you know, put them in an  uncomfortable situation going through the summer, then my guess is they are going to give blame both to bush and to davis. ??woodruff: all right, mark baldassare of the california public policy institute. ?thanks very much, good to see you again. ??baldassare: thank you. ?same here. ??woodruff: as california tries to ease its energy problems, there are  concerns about the cost not only for consumers, but for the environment. ?cnn's rusty dornin takes a closer look at the issues being raised by one california  plant's effort to expand. ??rusty dornin, cnn correspondent (voice-over): an aging giant known as the mighty moss. ?the 50-year-old moss landing natural gas plant along  california's coast owned by duke energy. ?a face lift and an expansion will soon make this the largest power generator in the state, providing 2.3 million homes with light, heat and air conditioning. ?but all that power takes water to cool the turbines, water that's home to otters, fish, herons and other wildlife. ??carolyn nielsen, plant opponent: every day, duke will use 333 football-size incomprehensible. ??dornin: water from the wetlands run through the plant, returning to the  ocean 30 degrees warmer. ?been that way for 50 years. ?now environmentalists worry that increasing the intake will sterilize any creature sucked in. ??patricia matejcek, sierra club: everything that lives in that volume of water: eggs from fish from clams, diatoms, young fish, everything in it will  be killed. ??dornin: environmentalists say the mighty moss got a break on the approval process, as regulators here faced the state's energy crisis. it took 14  months. permitting for smaller plants in the state is down to 21 days. ??kaitilin gaffney, center for marine conservation: it's so fast that my concern is that we wouldn't even catch really obvious problems because we are just are not taking a hard look at these plants at all. environmental groups signed off on the mighty moss renovation plan. ??gaffney: so at the eleventh hour, we were able to work out this deal with duke to at least ensure that the scientific monitoring will go on. the wetlands and in donations to local environmental groups. there will also be an independent monitor who will assess any damage to the environment. ??tom williams, duke energy: this will more than compensate any potential effects that the new power plant will have on the habitat. this state is in an energy crisis. ?the new plant we're bringing on is cleaner, more efficient  than virtually any plant in the country today. ??dornin: environmentalists made a deal here, but many fear, in a power-hungry state, taking what they can get may be their only option. ??rusty dornin, cnn, moss landing, california. seen in a whole new light in some circles. ?former president ford is honored  for ??that's next on inside politics. ??woodruff: it is something that many americans that lived through the watergate era might never dream they would see. ?an award named for a  democratic icon presented to the man who angered many democrats by pardoning richard  nixon. ??cnn's bruce morton has an inside view of this twist on political history. ??caroline kennedy schlossberg, john kennedy's daughter: he placed his love of country ahead of his own political future. ?we are honored to present you, president ford, with the john f. kennedy profile in courage award for 2001. award because, as a new unelected president, he pardoned his predecessor, richard nixon, who had resigned in disgrace to avoid impeachment over the watergate scandal. ??richard m. nixon, 37th president of the united states: i shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow. watergate. but really, what would end it? ?nixon could still face charges. ??gerald ford, 38th president of the united states: my conscience tells me  that only i, as president, have the constitutional power to firmly shut and seal  this book. ??ford: a full, free and absolute pardon unto richard nixon. ??morton: many americans thought that was a mistake. against his actions then, but time has a way of clarifying past events. ?and now we  see that president ford was right. ??morton: not everyone agrees. ?ford's press secretary at the time, gerald ter horst, resigned to protest the nixon pardon and still thinks it was wrong. ??jerry ter horst, former ford press secretary: he was going to go off house, from the chief of staff on down to ehrlichman, chuck colson and others  they were going to have to do prison time; they were not going to get pardons. many things could have swung it, but the pardon was surely one. ?jimmy carter, who beat ford, thanked him inauguration day. ??james earl carter, 39th president of the united states: for myself and for our nation, i want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our  land. ??morton: accepting the award, ford talked about the need for courage today in a politics dominated by ""partisan jockeying at the expense of public policy."" ??ford: i sense a longing for community, a desire on the part of americans to be part of something bigger, finer than themselves. ??morton: historians may still argue about the pardon. ?they agree he cared about his country and its politics, and did what he thought was right.

"thanks for your message. i do think we need to talk this through.  in the  meantime, though, let's not make anymore vps until this is resolved.  as i  said in my original message, i am not looking to undo what has been done, but  to make sure we don't do it again unless the process is followed.  i understand that there are significant title differences across the regions  we operate.  in fact, one of the people in my organization who did not make  vp is dennis vegas, who has done an extraordinary job in latin america.   notwithstanding his regional focus (and the significance of a vp title in his  region) he was put through the company wide process and he, david haug, and i  submit, everyone else on the exec comm, understood that every new vp would go  through the same process regardless of regional assignment (with the  exception of certain joint venture companies). but, i maintain that we need  enron-wide title, granted only through the prc process.  though i don't  personally feel this way, for many people in the organization the vp title  means something separate from the compensation structure; it implies  something like ""making partner"" in a legal or consulting firm. making that  cut should not vary based on where you live or what region you support.  i also understand the point about needing a certain title for external  purposes.  in my organization we are dealing with very title-conscious  elected officials and media.  i can make the case for every one of my  directors and senior directors that they would be more effective externally  if they carried a more senior title, regardless of any change in  compensation.  as an executive committee, we elected to make such an  made vp outside the process.  everyone in my organization from reading the e-mails on the issue regarding regional vice president at  enron india, it sounds like there will be more discussion on this issue. i  know that issues like this generally come up at the enron excom level. there  are a few issues that need to be kept in mind, and although cindy and i have  discussed these in the past, i have not had an opportunity to pursue them  further (but would be happy to help out on this). i have noticed these not  only in india but also in the other international settings where i have  worked for enron during the past several years. 1. international job titles and domestic job titles do not correlate. for  example, in india, the title ""director"" implies a very senior person within  the organization (well above vp), whereas in the enron domestic world, it is  a position below vp. ""managing director"" within enron is below the most  senior levels, but in india a md is the ken lay equivalent. for this reason,  i cannot use managing director in my title or on my business card, although  this is my title for enron houston purposes.  2. job titles are much more important in an international setting than in a  domestic setting. for example, in houston, we have people at the director  (and probably manager) level who lead deal teams and bring deals to  successful closing. in an international setting, particularly india, to get  to the decision-makers in your counterpart organization, an officer title of  vp or above is very often required. to a certain degree, this is form over  substance, but that's what works over here. 3. to solve some of these problems, enron should consider doing what some  other international companies have done (and i think cindy and her team may  already be working on this). a job banding study should be done and based on  responsibilities, everyone globally should be placed in a band. it would not  be a title band of vp or director or manager, but rather a band with a  non-title classification. i hate to suggest a band with numbers, such as 1  through 15, because that sounds way too much like the government, but  something like that would work. once this is done, communication is made to  employees that the band is what is key in determining their compensation and  level within the organization. then, the business units can rely on their  particular market dynamics or on what their competition is doing to determine  job titles. thus if the global origination group needs to have a title of  senior trader and eecc needs a title of project leader and enron india needs  a regional vice president, all can be accomplished while keeping these same  people at a consistent level for global enron purposes. i will be happy to discuss this further with any of you. plus, i will  volunteer to participate in finding a solution that works for all of enron  while taking into account  the specifc business unit and/or global function  needs. wade",0

(u.ene), duke energy corp. (duk), e.on ag  selling gas, sourced in the u.k., the netherlands and norway, in a number of  hubs between emden in germany and emshaven and oude statenzijl in the  netherlands.  david gallagher, head of european gas trading at enron in london, estimates  contract is done at the oude statenzijl hub, where the gasunie pipeline  system connects to the network of wingas gmbh.  an important element kick-starting short-term trading was the sale, in  contract to five dutch-based power generators.  robert van der hoeven, head of fuel procurement at electrabel, the owner of  dutch generator epon, said his company uses most of the gas it imports from  norway for its plants in the netherlands and trades the rest on a short-term  basis in the oude-emden area. this pattern is common to the other dutch-based  parties to that contract.  trading in dutch hubs received a further boost when nederlandse gasunie nv  (n.neg) decided, after months of wrangling with regulator dte, to lower its  commodity and service tariff, the so-called css system, from july 2001.  gasunie now claims its pipeline system is fully open and transparent. to  critics say the switching figure doesn't necessarily indicate an ideal system  of third-party access.  according to energy consultants the brattle group, around half of the gas  used by alternative suppliers goes through the 1 bcm/year zebra pipeline from  zelzate to zeeland, which was built by dutch utilities a few years ago  precisely because gasunie refused to provide access on favorable terms.  shippers have complained that the hourly system used by gasunie to balance  the pipeline system raises the overall cost of shipping through its network  significantly. gasunie imposes a balancing charge which effectively forces  shippers to pay for the extra gas brought into the system from storage sites,  in addition to the capacity and transmission price. critics say gasunie has  so far failed to unbundle these charges, although it agreed to do so in  january.  according to the brattle group, another controversial aspect of gasunie's  tariff system is that it is based on theoretical costs of constructing new  pipelines rather than its actual costs.  the dte is also considering ways of reforming the storage system to make it  competitive. bp plc (u.bp) and nederlandse aardolie maatschappij nv operate  storage facilities and lease capacity to gasunie through long-term contracts.  the regulator is studying ways of allowing third parties access to storage  facilities. gasunie has so far shown little sign of negotiating more  competitive tariffs with storage operators and passing on the benefits to  customers, critics say.  the growth of short-term trading in the dutch gas market is also inevitably  linked to its potential as a transit country for gas coming from the  u.k.-belgium gas interconnector and going towards the 82bcm-a-year german  market.  market participants say liquidity at the emden and oude hubs has grown  considerably since e.on and rwe started trading there earlier this year.  however, the obstructive attitude of incumbents toward third-party access  there has meant that so far most gas traded in the netherlands has remained  there.  reuters english news service new york, march 7 (reuters) - america's largest exporters are launching an  aggressive lobbying campaign on capitol hill to protect the export-import  bank from budget reductions, the wall street journal reported in its online  edition on wednesday.  the exporters, including boeing co. , caterpillar inc. , enron corp. ,  halliburton co. and others, are angry and confused that a republican  administration has targeted one of their favourite programmes for big cuts,  the paper reported. ex-im bank officials were not talking publicly, avoiding the appearance that  they are battling the white house to overturn the proposed 25 percent cut in  the bank's $865 million operating budget for the current fiscal year, which  the white house labels the ex-im bank as corporate welfare.

""trust me,"" craver said in a phone call after the conference. ""there are a  bloody nightmare.""  the disclosure comes at a time when an increasing number of power suppliers  are suing the utility for millions in unpaid bills.  edison also disclosed tuesday that two more lawsuits had landed in its lap -  one by a group of wind-powered generators including enron wind, the other by  two suppliers including new york-based caithness energy.  both suits were filed during the past five days, edison assistant general  counsel barbara reeves said. it was not immediately clear how much the  complainants were seeking; neither enron nor caithness returned calls for  comment.  the two filings bring the total number of suits by renewable-energy suppliers  against edison to four, the utility said. the city of long beach and  calenergy operating group, a geothermal supplier, have also sued for back  payments.  calenergy alone has said it is owed $45 million in november and december  payments.  the line sale, part of a multifaceted, tentative deal with the state that  could save edison from insolvency, could take anywhere from several months  into next year, craver said.  the tentative deal, announced by gov. gray davis feb. 23, calls for the state  to pay more than twice the book value for edison's lines.  it also would require edison to sell cheap power to the state for a decade  and for edison to end its lawsuit against state regulators. the suit asserts  that price caps imposed by the california public utilities commission are  illegal under federal law.  additionally, edison's parent would have to return $420 million it collected  from the utility over the past several years. the money was used to pay debt,  buy back stock and pay dividends to investors.  sce, pg&e and sempra have complained they are near bankruptcy because of  soaring prices on the open market combined with the state-imposed price caps  for consumers.  sempra and pg&e have yet to announce similar line-sale deals with the state,  though they and the governor have said negotiations are ongoing. the total  billion. sierra pacific ceo doubts sec ok of enron unit buy-report dow jones energy service los angeles -(dow jones)- sierra pacific resources (srp) ceo walter higgins  acquisition of enron corp.'s (ene) utility portland general electric will be  approved by the federal securities and exchange commission, the las vegas sun  reported tuesday.  the sec must find that sierra pacific is in a strong financial position  before it will approve the deal, but the company is currently weakened by  having lost millions of dollars in fuel and purchased power costs, higgins  said in the report. said that money would only pay back those expenses and wouldn't improve the  company's stability to a level the sec would find adequate, according to the  report.  the public utilities commission can halt the rate hike and order refunds if  it decides the hike isn't necessary. the puc is holding hearings to determine  the prudency of the hike, and members of the state's powerful casino and  mining industries have filed to intervene.  sierra pacific's plan to shore up its financial position through the sale of  state senate is considering a bill to block the sales, and nevada gov. kenny  guinn recently sent a letter to the puc asking that it reconsider its order  allowing electric utilities to sell assets.  financial analysts have said that not allowing sierra pacific's two utilities  to sell their assets would have a ripple effect on the company's financial  position. the asset sales are tied to low-priced power contracts, and if the  sales are canceled, the low-priced power will be gone as well.  ""if the divestiture is stopped...the state may be dealing with a much bigger  rate increase,"" steve fleishman, merrill lynch utility analyst, told dow  jones newswires recently.  sierra pacific is the parent company of electric utilities sierra pacific  power co. and nevada power, which serve customers in the state's north and  south, respectively.  many power deals announced by california governor still not final by jason leopold dow jones business news dow jones newswires  california gov. gray davis this week remain under negotiation or are the  the lack of finality to the deals raises questions about the state's success  in covering its power needs, particularly going into what is expected to be  an unusually tight summer.  generators said privately they were surprised the governor went ahead with  his announcement monday, given that many of the contracts haven't been  signed.  david freeman, general manager of the los angeles department of water and  power, who negotiated the contracts on behalf of the state, conceded that  details remain to be worked out. ""this is not a done deal,"" mr. freeman said,  adding that credit concerns are keeping generators from signing the deals.  gov. davis announced monday that california has secured 40 long-term  contracts that will provide california with about 629 million megawatt hours  hour is roughly the amount of electricity needed to power 1,000 homes.  several of those forward deals, however, involve contracts originally held by  edison international (eix) unit southern california edison and pg&e corp.  (pcg) unit pacific gas & electric at the california power exchange,  previously the state's main power market.  the governor seized those contracts earlier this year, just before the power  exchange liquidated them to cover hundreds of millions of dollars in power  bills the utilities had failed to pay.  the contracts, which total about 1.3 million megawatt hours of electricity  and have a market value of about $1 billion, according to market sources,  one of the suppliers that sold the contracts to pacific gas and socal ed, has  sued gov. davis for unlawfully commandeering those contracts.  although duke has reached an interim settlement to continue providing power  to the state department of water resources until april 30, the company and  the davis administration still have to ""develop a comprehensive long-term  settlement to pay for the power supply contracts,"" said duke spokesman tom  williams.  the governor went ahead with the announcement, because the california  department of water resources believes it will be able to finalize and sign  the contracts over the next several weeks, davis spokesman steve maviglio  said.  including duke, reliant energy inc. (rei), mirant corp. (mir), sempra energy,  agreements with the state, although negotiations were ongoing.  ""we are working in good faith with the dwr toward a long-term contract,"" said  art larson, spokesman for sempra energy resources, a unit of sempra. mr.  larson said sempra signed a terms of agreement with the water-resources  department and expects to reach a final agreement over the next several  weeks.  reliant said it has only signed a short-term contract with the state that  expires in about two weeks. the company will only sign a long-term contract  spokesman richard wheatley said.  mirant said it also won't sign contracts with the state until it's paid.  enron said it's reached agreement on terms with the state, but has some  credit-related details to hammer out. ""everything's been agreed to except for  some credit technicalities,"" enron spokesman mark palmer said.  meanwhile, small, independent power plants in california that are capable of  generating 1,800 megawatts of power are shut down because their owners  haven't been paid by the state's two main utilities, the california  independent system operator said tuesday.  the decline in small-plant output has contributed to the state's power-supply  problems the past two months. partnerships involving el paso corp. (epg), for  example, shut down 350 megawatts of generation last weekend due to  nonpayment, the company said tuesday.  socal ed hasn't paid the owners of the smaller generators, known as  ""qualifying facilities,"" since early december, which means the generators are  still owed for electric production in october, while pg&e has paid only a  small percentage of its qualifying facility bills since its last full payment  in early january.  the plants, one-third of which are powered by renewable sources like wind and  solar power, meet almost 30% of california's electricity needs. almost all of  the closed generators are fueled by natural gas, and many haven't been able  to pay their gas suppliers and have been cut off from their gas supply.  the california senate energy committee plans to vote on legislation to create  a new pricing system for all qualifying facilities this week. the proposed  bill would cut the prices to qualifying facilities from about 17 cents a  kilowatt-hour the past eight months to about eight cents, depending on the  price of five-year natural-gas contracts the generators can sign. the plants  that run on renewable resources would be paid 5.4 cents a kilowatt-hour.  write to jason leopold at   all rights reserved us natural gas prices fall as demand slips in most areas dow jones energy service houston -(dow jones)- u.s. natural gas physical prices fell tuesday as demand  eased, except in the northeast and southeast areas of the country, traders  said.  heavy snowstorms in the upper northeast supported some pricing, as did cooler  weather in georgia, the carolinas and the florida panhandle. some storage buying occurred in texas ""if they could make it work,"" a trader  said.  ""it was a pretty uneventful day,"" a gulf coast trader said late tuesday.  also, because of the snowstorm in the northeast, traders had purchased gas  ahead of time to make up for needed load, he said.  a scheduled work outage on enron's transwestern san juan lateral in new  mexico was completed, and the return of a power plant in california  alleviated demand in the west, traders said.  british thermal units, west coast traders said, down as much as $15 from  monday.  in the midwest, chicago citygate prices fell 7 cents-8 cents to a range of  the nymex april natural gas futures contract settled at $5.315/mmbtu, down  2.1 cents in a tight, range-bound, uneventful session that started late due  to bad weather.  physical gas prices at the benchmark henry hub in south louisiana ended in a  transcontinental gas pipe line at station 65 deals were made in a similar ",0
"the senate governmental affairs committee held an unusually long hearing  and other related energy issues.  the ""star witness"" was gov. davis.  others  were govs. martz of montana and hoeven of north dakota against price caps,  sens. murkowski, murray and cantwell, washington state's attorney general,  oregon's puc chairman, and the five ferc commissioners.  once davis left  after several hours of testimony and two rounds of questions, most of the  press and audience left. enron was mentioned several times as follows:  1. sen. thompson, the ranking republican, mentioned lockyer's ""spike""  comments in the context of asking gov. davis about why business would make  new investments in the state when on top of the regulatory uncertainty, there  is the broader political hostility expressed in this way by state officials.   davis had two chances to disavow lockyer and did not.  (thompson gave him a  second chance when he basically repeated the question and made specific  reference again to ""spike,"" asking davis if ferc acted this week because of  the ag's spike comments.)  the first time davis said that the people he  represents are mad, they want him to fight back, this is rough business, the  industry people are used to a wildcatter's environment, things occassionally  said that the state was building new power plants and investment was not  being diminished. handling of the situation, using quotes from california newspapers to make  the case that davis was slow to act.  he also argued that the state had done  a bad job as a power purchaser, contrasting the state's recent 8-year  republicans also pressed davis on why he attacks out-of-state generators but  is not nearly as vocal about california munis who charged even more.  davis  said they should make refunds, too.  3. while not saying enron by name, gov. davis did make a comment about  companies with ""trading floors that compete with the new york stock exchange  with meteorologists and very talented people"" who might have the ability to  find loopholes in the new order.  he said this in answer to a question about  what ferc needed to do now that the new order was issued, and he said ""watch   4. sen. thompson pressed washington state ag gregoire about why she appeared  to be investigating out-of-state suppliers even though they had a small  percentage of the market in her state, with lots of document requests and  other investigative action, while not doing the same to others.  during that  exchange either thompson or the ag (i think it was the ag) said enron had  she said she would be expanding her inquiry, though. highlights and analysis  1. as started at yesterday's senate energy hearing, the mantra from the  western democrats was: we want our money back.  chairman lieberman and others  pressed ferc about how california could get refunds and the same in other  western states, particularly oregon and washington.  chairman hebert said  that the settlement conference process would allow all parties to raise all  issues, including refunds in california and outside california.  he said that  the conference could include issues that the commission could not act on  itself, including refunds not otherwise allowed under the federal power act.   chairman lieberman vowed to keep the committee active in overseeing ferc's  activities in implementing the new order, particularly as it relates to  refunds.  while he acknowledged that new legislation could not apply to  pending cases, he seemed inclined to pursue legislation to repeal the 60 day  delay in the federal power act relating to refunds.  2. commissioner wood spoke of the need to increase the penalities and  enforcement tools available to the commission, including the ability to order  short suspensions of authority for regulated entities to transact business,  treble damages, and other administrative penalties.  there was also  discussion among the committee and commissioners about beefing up ferc's  market monitoring capabilities so that it acted more like the sec, fcc and  ftc than it has in the past.  3. the democrats on the committee and among the witnesses said that ferc's  latest order is a step in the right direction.  none of them called for  legislative action on price caps as proposed by sens. feinstein and smith.   sen. murkowski had done a good job of taking the wind out of the legislated  price cap sails by saying at the start of the hearing when he testified that  the bill's sponsors had pulled back from swift action when they spoke at  yesterday's hearing.  davis did say the still thinks that cost-based rates  corrected the mistakes in the april order.  4. there was some discussion of natural gas again.  davis said that ferc  should now turn its attention to natural gas.  he said that el paso  controlled too much of the capacity until recently.  he called on ferc to  enforce laws against price manipulation.  (note: we have had several back  channel reports that the lieberman committee intends to look into the el paso  and williams cases now at ferc about alleged affiliate issues.)  5. there was some discussion of the termination of the new ferc order.   lieberman pressed several witnesses about whether sept. 2002 is too soon.   more time and that order should apply until california has enough new  generation in place.  hebert did not back down when pressed by lieberman  later in the hearing, saying there needs to be a deadline to get action on  new supplies, however he and the others basically said they would revisit the  issue if events warrant.  6. several times, sen. lieberman and others said they generally support  deregulation, but that the effort to get more states to do so will never  happen if the price situation is not brought under control and public  confidence restored.  7. gov. davis did throw a few kind words toward pres. bush and pat wood,  saying that each was open to doing more about the high cost of natural gas to  california, including the possible reimposition of rate regulation of  transportation to california.  he said he liked pat wood and he noted that  ferc did not take serious price mitigation action until the two new bush  appointees were on the commission.  8. lieberman asked the washington state ag whether the justice dept. or the  ftc were doing anything to address high energy prices.  she said not to her  knowledge even though she has asked them to do so.  we can expect a  lieberman, et al request for justice and ftc involvement going forward, i  suspect.  9. while chairman lieberman's tone and closing comments were in the nature  of his normal thoughtful tone, it is clear that he and others see this as a  major issue for them to ride.  he commended ferc at the end of the hearing  for doing their best, but pledged he would stay involved, closing the session ",0

"per our discussion this morning, below is a summary of items to discuss with glynn: adding enron's ""negative ctc claim"" to the list of claims: pge's filing included a list of top twenty creditors.  our negative ctc claim was apparently not taken into account in compiling that list.  the list is nonbinding, however.  pg&e will be required to file schedules of creditors on april 20.  our negative ctc claim should be on schedule f (for unsecured claims).  you may want to remind glynn of your previous conversations and state our expectation that the negative ctc claim will appear (preferably as uncontested) in the april 20 filing. (note: if pg&e does not include the claim we have an opportunity to file a proof of claim and ultimately the court determines the validity of the claim). including enron on the creditors' committee:  pg&e may have the opportunity to influence representation on the creditors' committees.  there are several reasons to suggest to glynn that we be included: 1) we are a big creditor, 2) we could be helpful in crafting a broader solution, and 3) we are one of the real parties in interest behind the px and iso (who were listed as significant creditors but are really just ""passthroughs"" for the suppliers ... and pg&e likely would not want to have those political bodies serving on the creditors committee anyway).",0

"	please respond to nobody bit in san diego county, ...  electricity crisis cools down a bit in san diego county, calif. dan mcswain  escondido, california copyright (c) 2000 krtbn knight ridder tribune business  an uneasy aftermath has settled over this summer's power price shocks in san  diego county, punctuated this weekend by cool weather and falling electricity  prices, as the state and federal policy-making apparatus shifts from a season  of panicked damage control to the extremely difficult question of what to do  next. in the parlance of the electricity industry, these are the ""shoulder"" months;  a breather between periods of heavy demand for summer cooling and winter  heating in which power-generating plants are typically pulled out of  commission for trouble-shooting, overdue maintenance and refueling.  california's pioneering deregulation of its electricity industry lies in a  state of exhaustion. guarantees from politicians of greater efficiency and  lower prices have collapsed this summer into chronic power shortages and a  the buyers of electricity to the sellers. optimism is in short supply as a fractious collection of stakeholders and the  nation's political and regulatory institutions begin to search for solutions. emergency legislation approved by state lawmakers in august will temporarily  reduce bills for the 1.2 million customers of san diego gas & electric co.  diego county and parts of south orange county became the first region in the  nation under deregulation law to directly pay the wholesale price of  electricity. cool weather has caused demand for power to sag this weekend, bringing prices  down from their lofty summer peaks to about 7.5 cents per kilowatt hour on  friday. but while the legislation has capped rates at 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour for  sdgocustomers, the utility will continue to pay the volatile wholesale cost  of power, which averaged 21.4 cents this month. historically, prices have  fallen to as low as 1 cent per kilowatt in the winter months, but this year  prices seem likely to exceed 6.5 cents for most of the year, and take off  analysts say generating and power marketing companies will retain their  ability to raise prices, called market power, because their costs are higher  and supplies of power are tight in the pacific northwest. sdgosays the legislation could create a shortfall, to be financed by the  public utilities commission has allowed the utility to pass on such  shortfalls to consumers in the form of higher rates. pacific gas&electric and southern california edison, the state's other  investor-owned utilities, have collectively lost at least $3.3 billion this  summer because their retail rates have remain capped under deregulation. both  utilities are seeking to end their retail rate caps early to escape the risk  of sustained high wholesale prices. consumer groups are outraged; investors are skeptical. three major credit  rating companies said the california utilities face increased regulatory  uncertainty, and the utilities' stock prices fell last week. a hot-potato mentality is emerging among policy-makers who say the authority  to clamp down on market behavior has been dispersed by deregulation. california regulators and consumer advocates have great expectations for a  series of state and federal investigations into the causes of higher prices  and into charges of market manipulation and price gouging by power companies.  chief among them is an investigation by the federal energy regulatory  commission that may lead to changes in california's power trading system. ""unfortunately, we have ceded most of our authority over wholesale markets to  the federal government,"" said loretta lynch, the president of the california  public utilities commission, the state's top regulator. james hoecker, the chairman of the federal commission, said lynch overstates  the case. ""california has not given me one scintilla of authority that i  didn't already have,"" hoecker said in august. the federal commission has been critical of california's approach to  deregulation, but has been reluctant to intervene in interstate wholesale  markets, into state trading systems, or to make aggressive use of its  investigative powers. what is dawning on california policy-makers, analysts say, is the hard lesson  that deregulation transfers considerable authority away from government  officials and to the market participants. the challenge is to get  deregulation right the first time. ""the problem is not deregulation,"" said robert mccullough, an economist and  former utility executive based in portland, ore. ""the problem is this rube  goldberg device that has been constructed in california."" the trading practices of power marketers in the west also is under scrutiny  by the federal commission. regulators informed electricity marketing  companies in august that if price gouging is found, the refund of some  profits may be ordered by the commission for windfall profits that are earned  after mid-october. a surprising number of observers say generators have simply acted in their  own interest and taken advantage of the rules to make money. ranging from  consumer advocates to economists to some regulators themselves, many say  bungled deregulation is a more likely cause of high prices than a conspiracy  of generating companies. ""this market has behaved very rationally this summer,"" said frank wolak, a  stanford economist who chairs the market surveillance committee of  california's power transmission manager. ""all you need is tight supply to  exercise market power in this market; you don't need collusion."" a titanic shift is shaping up in the way power is bought on the wholesale  markets on behalf of california consumers. all three utilities have been  granted authority by state regulators to make confidential deals for  electricity directly with individual generators or power trading companies,  largely bypassing the state's nonprofit power exchange. in an equally important development, the manager of most of california's  transmission system has asked federal regulators for permission to sign  long-term deals for power. up to now, the transmission manager has been  limited to last-minute purchases of emergency power to stabilize the grid. critics fear both measures are steps toward reinstating the system that  existed before deregulation, in which a small number of buyers made large,  long-term deals with a handful of suppliers. the architects of california's deregulation, fearing the monopoly power of  the utilities, had stripped bilateral purchasing authority to foster  competition among a new kind of retail power provider. under the scheme,  utilities were to be limited to the highly regulated business of electricity  distribution folder name: utilities, electric: deregulation relevance score  review or revise your folder, visit dow jones customclipsor contact dow jones  your local sales representative.)

""in a more sinister form of cogeneration, corporations are converting economic into political power,"" he says. ""a bush election fueled by enron dollars could ignite in the public policy arena, and consumers would get burned.""   amnesty international and human rights watch have both criticized enron for colluding with police who brutally suppressed protests at the company's giant power plant in western india. the plant's operating firm is called the dabhol power company. from 1992 to electricity board bought a 30 percent share of the company, which   for years, the plant has been the site of many nonviolent protests.

""while we respect the mission of human rights watch, we do not feel that its report on the dabhol power project is accurate,"" says an enron spokesperson. ""the report refers to peaceful protests, when, in fact, the reason the police were positioned near our site is that there have been many acts of violence against our employees and contractors. dabhol power company has worked hard to promote positive relations with the community. unfortunately, the good relationship we have built with a large percentage of the community was not reflected in the report. enron is committed to providing energy and communications services while preserving the human rights of citizens and our workers.""   enron has also raised a stink in bolivia with its involvement in the cuiaba integrated energy project. the project is run by transredes, bolivia's hydrocarbon transport company, which came into being in 1997 after bolivia privatized its oil sector under the influence of the world bank. a joint venture of enron and shell owns pipeline erupted and dumped an estimated 10,000 barrels of refined crude oil and gasoline into the desaguadero river, which supports indigenous communities such as the uru muratos.   ""this problem is transredes's number one priority, and we are committed to continue to work hard to mitigate the short- and long-term social and environmental impact,"" wrote steve hopper, president of transredes, in a letter addressed ""to the people of bolivia"" on february 7.   facing starvation from the loss of their life-sustaining waterfowl and fish, the uru muratos left their ancestral lands at the southern shores of lake poopo in april and marched eighty-five miles to the city of oruro to ask for government help.   ""we subsequently reached an agreement with them to provide certain levels of relief and assistance,"" says keith miceli, general manager for public relations for enron, south america.   in its actions overseas, enron has made a practice of taking advantage of corporate welfare. and it has enlisted george w bush in this effort. subsequently released to the press under texas open records laws, asking him to contact every member of the texas delegation in congress to explain how ""export credit agencies of the united states are critical to u.s. developers like enron, who are pursuing international projects in developing countries."" these agencies include the overseas private investment corporation (opic), which provides political risk coverage and financial support to u.s. companies investing abroad.   ""opic provided financing or insurance coverage worth almost $300 million for enron's foreign projects just last year, according to government records,"" the new york times reported. ""enron officials have in the past asked mr. bush to help lobby lawmakers to appropriate funds of opic, as well as for the export-import bank, another federal agency that aids american companies abroad.""   the enron methanol plant in pasadena, texas, lies in the houston ship channel area, the nation's largest concentration of petrochemical plants just east of the city. the plant has won special concessions from governor bush, allowing the company to pollute without a permit, as well as giving it immunity from prosecution for violating some environmental standards.   plants like this in texas cumulatively emit twice as much nitrogen oxide, a key ingredient of smog, as do all the nine million cars in texas put together. permitted had enron not gotten away with this under the ""grandfather before 1971 to continue their polluting practices. bush extended this clause under the 1999 clean air responsibility enterprise (care) program that his office drew up in a series of secret meetings with representatives of the top polluters in the state, as molly ivins reported. care waives permit requirements for plants that volunteer to cut emissions. 1995 giving sweeping protections to polluters that perform internal environmental or safety audits. the law makes these audit documents confidential and allows polluters to escape responsibility for environmental violations. to date, enron has conducted five such audits and filed for immunity from prosecution for violations of the law, according to the texas natural resources conservation commission (tnrcc), the state equivalent of the environmental protection agency.   tamara maschini, who lives about five miles from the enron plant, is one of the founders of a local environmental group called clean air clear lake.

""if the grandfather clause was canceled right now, we would benefit the most of any of the companies in texas because our nitrogen oxide emissions add up to less than half a percent of the total,"" he says.   last year, the bush campaign borrowed enron's corporate jets eight times to fly aides around the country, more times than any of the thirty-four other companies that made their company aircraft available to the presidential hopeful.   and lay often acts as george w. bush's chaperone. president, at the houston astros' first home game of the season. the game was held in the baseball team's brand new stadium-enron million contract to supply power to the stadium in return.)   less than three weeks later, lay joined candidate bush in washington, d.c., for a republican fundraiser that topped all previous records by bringing in a staggering $21.3 million, easily the biggest one-night haul for any political party in history. active in republican politics,"" says ray sullivan, a spokesman for the bush campaign.

"effect on us, etc.?  why was dave on this distribution? 	david w delainey@ees david: say spp, main, mapp, wscc, or frcc, has a major blackout this summer and the ""loyal opposition"" ""discovers"" that said region has refused to sign an agreement such as this and not implemented the program required by the agreement.  that may even constitute ""willful neglect.""  wouldn't it be even worst if the ""discovery"" showed that the region was not signed because the region wanted to use it's position as a bargaining ploy? (spp, frcc, and mike regional managers compliance task force as we discussed on the conference call on friday, i have prepared a simple draft letter of intent for the use of those regions who wish to indicate support for the regional compliance and enforcement program, but are not yet in a position to sign the agreement for regional compliance and enforcement programs that the nerc board of trustees approved on february for the benefit of those who were not on the call, i'd like to recap where things stand at this point.  my apologies if i mischaracterize anyone's position.  npcc and ercot have signed the agreement.  ecar has stated it will sign the agreement at the signing ceremony on march 30.  spp is prepared to sign the agreement, but doesn't want to be the only one it its part of the eastern interconnection to do so.  frcc was not on the call, but has previously stated that it is prepared to sign so long as at least six regions sign.  mapp and main have indicated that they prefer to develop their program with their own members before they sign the nerc agreement.  wscc may need to consider the matter at its board meeting in early april.  serc has the matter under consideration.  i have not heard from maac, but it has a meeting scheduling for march 29. i want to share with you my concern for the climate in washington.  in the past few weeks i have had occasion to speak with a number of people on capitol hill and in the new administration.  all are very concerned about what might happen this summer.  if a serious incident occurs, i am quite wisely is a different question.  we have the opportunity with this agreement for the industry to take charge of its own destiny.  if congress acts it may well assign a very central role to the federal government to take direct responsibility for reliability.  there are those in the department of energy who are pushing for such a role.   congressman barton is talking of the possibility of emergency legislation, possibly within the next few weeks.  if the industry pulls together, i believe we can forestall direct governmental controls, just as in 1965.  if the industry does not step up, then congress may well assign the responsibility elsewhere. the ctg recommended to the board that a critical mass of six regions sign onto the agreement before it goes forward.  for those regions that are considering developing their own programs with their members before they sign the agreement, with the view of having the capg determine in advance whether their programs meets the requirements of the agreement, i ask you to consider this:  if we don't get a critical mass of regions to sign, then the capg may not come into existence. the nerc/regions agreement is really an undertaking by the regions to work to develop their own regional compliance and enforcement program with their members.  my request remains that each of the regions sign the agreement by the march 30 board meeting.  that will assure that we are able to make the governance changes that we have all been working for.  if any region is to demonstrate support for the program.  that may be enough to satisfy those who have stated that moving forward on the compliance program is a condition to their support of the governance changes. thanks very much for your consideration of the program and all the work you've put into this transition so far.  please let me know if you have questions or if there is anything that we can do from here to be of assistance to you.",0
"ray alvarez brought to my attention today a news item indicating that the congressional budget office released a report earlier this week entitled ""causes and lessons of the california electricity crisis.""  the 30+ page report is available on the home page of the cbo's web site at www.cbo.gov.  i have quickly read through the summary and it is largely favorable.  for example, the summary says: ""even without restructuring, california's electric utilities would have faced a difficult challenge in meeting the demand for power and holding down prices in 2000."" ""consequently, wholesale electricity prices were higher than they probably would have been in either a traditionally regulated market or a more fully deregulated market."" ""long-term solutions to california's electricity problems will most likely require three changes: removing barriers to the addition of generating capacity, eliminating bottlenecks in the electricity transmission system, and removing regulatory restrictions on the sale of power throughout the broad western market."" on the negative side, the report summary does state that ""some generators may also have withheld supplies at certain times to boost prices even more"" and ""the plan's auction system for the spot market appears to have created strong incentives for suppliers to bid strategically in a way that raised wholesale prices.""",0
"the energy and air quality subcommittee meet for almost six hours today and  approved an amended version of h.r. 1647, chairman barton's emergency  and commerce committee may take it up as early as next week (probably  the subcommittee defeated an amendment by rep. waxman (d-ca) to impose  all republicans voting against, including the three from california and rep.  cap amendment, was the most forceful and articulate in opposition to the  tracked our whip count going into the meeting. rep. albert wynn (d-md) offered and withdrew an amendment to delete the  ""negawatts"" provision.  there was bipartisan criticism that while the concept  made sense, there were potential problems in terms of possible games playing,  including end users being able to sell power while not actualy reducing their  normal power levels.  another member said that electric coops that are  required to sell at cost could have customers then go out and resell that  power and make a lot of money.  several members said businesses could shut  down, put workers out of work and become energy marketers and make more  money.  chairman barton made a forceful defense of negawatts.  while the  amendment to strike was deleted, we will need to respond to these criticisms  and shore this up before full committee next week.  there will be another  attempt to delete at full committee unless these concerns are addressed in an  amended version. ranking democrat rick boucher (d-va) offered and withdrew an amendment to  reinstate ferc maximum prices for the secondary transmission market, thus  chairman  barton said he agreed with boucher that there is a problem with  what appear to be high gas transmission rates to california, but he disagrees  with the proposed remedy.  he pledged to work with boucher before full  committee mark-up. we are obtaining a copy of this amendment and should  analyze it asap for its potential impact on enron operations. rep. ed markey (d-ma) offered and withdrew an amendment to impose a series of  new tests to be administered by ferc all with the goal of discouraging spot  market transactions, or at least what he would define as excessive use of the  spot market, and at the same time encourage ""deep bilateral mechanisms.""  the  mechanisms included a ""market balance test"" that would say only sellers with  a commitment to the long term market could sell in the spot market at  unregulated rates and ""spot market circuit breakers"" that would be triggered  when reserves are low in a given market.  chairman barton said he likes the  concept of a spot market circuit breaker, but felt that the amendment was too  complicated to be evaluated today.  we will also pursue an analysis of this  amendment since it will likely be offered again in some form. mr. markey also offered and withdrew a ""net metering"" proposal that would  establish federal interconnection standards for individual consumers who  would want to use fuel cells and other renewable technology to put power onto  the system.  it was interesting that those who opposed negawatts spoke  favorably of net metering even though they are complementary. the subcommittee by voice vote adopted a walden amendment to strike the  governors approved it.  the debate was pro-rto but the rationale for deleting  the provision is that one is already being formed and members from those  states did not want to upset the work already under way. a series of other amendments on other matters were offered and withdrawn,  none of which relate to our activities.",0

"in our litigation meeting last tuesday, we learned that netting of spot purchases and sales is of paramount importance in limiting our exposure to refunds, under the ferc's july 26 order, in both the california and pacific northwest proceedings.  however, in the california proceeding we are also afforded the opportunity in the order to offset our receivables against any refund that would otherwise have to be paid by us.  also, to the extent that our receivables exceed the refund amount, the order provides for payment of interest to us in accordance with cfr section 35.19a.   at present, i am aware of the existence of three receivables.  as you will recall, i mentioned at tuesday's meeting that we should be able to treat as a receivable for purposes of offset, the revenues due us from the application of the caiso underscheduling penalty.  i communicated the possibility of offsetting this receivable against any potential refund at this mornings western wholesale conference call, and subsequent research conducted by alan comnes indicates that the caiso owes us $30mm, as per the caiso's own numbers. the caiso also owes us approximately $40mm due to nonpayment for one to two months of business.  these two figures alone, totalling approximately $70mm, exceed the estimate of our potential exposure in the california proceeding. finally, the negative ctc issue is another receivable due us by iou's that, under the plain language of the order, could potentially be used to offset any refund amount.  i am not aware of the magnitude of this receivable but do understand that there are some sensitivities regarding this issue, including concerns about revealing the amount of the credit due us.  it is likely that the amount would become public if it is presented in the california proceeding. please give us your thoughts as to the use of the ctc receivable to offset potential refunds in the california proceeding.",0

"yes.  mary will discuss with you. michelle cash enron north america corp. this message may contain confidential information that is protected by the  attorney-client and/or work product privileges. 	steven j kean@enron today, mary joyce and i met with wanda curry.  i realize that there is some  concern that wanda is a litigation threat, so for the purposes of soliciting  legal advice and in anticipation of litigation, i am forwarding my  recollection of today's meeting to you: wanda remains very emotional about what she perceives as ""unfair and  discriminatory"" treatment.  when i asked her what she meant specifically (and  did she intend those terms to have their legal meaning), she said that she  ""personal"" level,  felt that the company should have treated her better.  she  mentioned specifically: that no one ever called to explain in detail why she  had not been further promoted at enron or given more responsibility at enron,  that she viewed the job in sally beck's organization as unsatisfactory  (because sally should be treated as a peer, not a superior), and that she  felt as though she did not have the support of upper management of the  company. i described several options for her: take the job she was offered in sally beck's organization; again) take severence under the standard package; take severence as a ""business reorg"" but consult with enron for a period. at first she seemed most interested in the fourth option (although she wasn't  particularly happy about any of the  alternatives), but at the end of the  discussion expressed interest in the second option. a large part of the conversation involved discussion of wanda's complaints  about how she had been treated.  most of wanda's concerns focussed on jobs  she did not get, or jobs she felt were taken from her, reduced scope of  control, and the fact that she felt that her supervisors did not communicate  with her sufficiently prior to or subsequent to making their decisions about  job assignments.  i suggested that there were likely two sides to the story  and that most of the problem was insufficient communication or perhaps some  insensitivity.  i also pointed out that in all my conversations i heard good  things about her performance and had no indication that anyone had treated  her unfairly. wanda did complain about many things, but never once complained about her pay  at enron. mary, these are my recollections from today.  do you have anything to add?",4
