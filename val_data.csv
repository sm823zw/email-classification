markets around the world continue to struggle with the problem of incentivizing generators whose output, due to their location in the grid, has no viable substitutes.  such generators possess 'local' market power.  since these generators also compete in broader regional markets, the actions taken to exploit their local market power can also effect market outcomes over larger areas.  in california, a contract structure known as the reliability must-run (rmr) contract was developed to address the problem of local market power.  however, the contract form that was in place during 1998 created serious incentive problems.  we find that, during the months of june through september 1998, rmr contracts had the effect of raising overall supply bid prices from most producers, thereby leading to higher energy prices in the california regional market. download this paper in adobe acrobat format: http://www.ucei.berkeley.edu/ucei/pdf/pwp070.pdf ""electricity markets: should the rest of the world adopt the uk reforms?"" policy makers everywhere have analyzed and tried to learn from the uk electricity restructuring, adopting some of the same market features but modifying others. now the british government has embarked on a radical reform of their electricity industry, called the programme to reform the electricity trading arrangements or ""reta."" the changes to the electricity market are slated for september 2000. some of the changes will bring the uk in line with what other countries have done, but other changes will be unique. is the uk poised to leapfrog the rest of the world, adopting every market feature that has proved successful and modifying those that have not? should the rest of the world be following the uk's lead on some of these changes? this paper argues that the answer is a decisive ""no"" to both questions. while proposed reforms to introduce demand-side bidding and encourage financial innovation make sense, the government's proposal to pay suppliers their bids rather than the market clearing price will not help achieve the stated goals of fostering competition and lowering prices. download this paper in adobe acrobat format: http://www.ucei.berkeley.edu/ucei/pdf/pwp069.pdf ""does incentive regulation provide the correct incentives?: stochastic many policy-makers are currently weighing the advantages of deregulating electricity markets over more traditional regulatory methods. however, within this traditional regulatory environment many options exist.  in particular, the use of incentive regulation programs in us electricity markets has grown during the past two decades. these programs differ in both their goals and how they attempt to meet these goals. in this paper, i discuss the wide array of programs that have been utilized, and investigate the impact of individual programs on the technical efficiency of a large set of coal and natural gas generator units. within a stochastic frontier framework, i allow the distribution of inefficient production to be a function of the regulatory environment the plant operates under. the results suggest that while certain incentive regulations increase observed technical efficiency, others have either no effect or even lead to a reduction in efficiency. download this paper in adobe acrobat format: http://www.ucei.berkeley.edu/ucei/pdf/pwp068.pdf ""understanding competitive pricing and market power in wholesale discussions of competition in restructured electricity markets have revealed many misunderstandings about the definition, diagnosis,

supply constraints.  i also address two common myths about market power: (a) that firms to remain profitable in markets with significant fixed costs.  i conclude by arguing that, while a finding of market power in an industry does not necessarily indicate that government intervention is warranted, such analysis is an important part of creating sound public policy. download this paper in adobe acrobat format: http://www.ucei.berkeley.edu/ucei/pdf/pwp067.pdf ""pricing electricity for default customers: pass through or california electricity consumers can choose a retail electricity service provider, but most have not done so. these consumers remain, by default, customers of the utility distribution companies (udcs). pricing electricity for these default customers is now an issue before the california public utilities commission. in california this issue is framed largely in terms of two alternatives: pass through of the wholesale electricity price or a performance-based rate (pbr). under the first alternative, purchase from the california power exchange (px) would be mandatory; under the second, each udc would determine where to purchase supply and each udc's performance would be gauged by comparing its costs to the px price. this paper identifies issues that should be addressed in choosing between the two alternatives. first the paper examines the effects of the two alternatives on electricity prices. the analysis suggests that, at least in the near term, the choice will not have much effect on prices. next the paper looks at possible perverse incentives. a central concern here is that, if providing default service becomes profitable, udcs might use their distribution assets to stifle competition in the retail market. finally, the paper examines regulatory costs associated with the alternatives and concludes that regulatory costs are likely to be higher under a pbr. download this paper in adobe acrobat format:

and natural gas markets have traditionally been serviced by one of two market structures. in some markets, electricity and natural gas are sold by a dual-product regulated monopolist, while in other markets, electricity and natural gas are sold by separate single-product regulated monopolies. this paper analyzes the relative pricing and investment decisions of electricity firms operating in the two market structures. the unique relationship between these two products, namely that electricity and natural gas are substitutes in consumption and natural gas is an input into the generation of electricity, allows me to gain inferences regarding the efficacy of regulation in both the electricity and natural gas industries. the results imply that both electricity prices and reliance on natural gas generation are higher in a dual-product setting, both suggestive that regulators respond to the relative incentives of electricity and natural gas firms. download this paper in adobe

wolak effective competition in wholesale electricity markets is the cornerstone of the deregulation of the electricity generation industry. we examine the degree of competition in the california wholesale electricity market during june-november 1998 by comparing the market prices with estimates of the prices that would have resulted if all firms were price takers. we find that there were significant departures from competitive pricing and that it was most pronounced during the highest demand periods. overall, this raised the cost of power purchases by about 22% above the competitive level. we also explain why the prices observed cannot be attributed to competitive peak-load pricing. download this paper in adobe acrobat format: http://www.ucei.berkeley.edu/ucei/pdf/pwp064.pdf ""zonal pricing and demand-side bidding in the norwegian electricity market""  pwp-063 by tor arnt johnsen, shashi kant verma, and catherine wolfram pwp-063 analyzes prices in the day-ahead electricity market in norway. we consider the hypothesis that generators are better able to exercise market power when transmission constraints bind, resulting in smaller, more-concentrated markets. we test this hypothesis by comparing equilibrium prices across periods with different demand elasticity and with and without binding transmission constraints. we find some empirical evidence that prices in local markets are higher during constrained periods when demand is less elastic. download this paper in adobe acrobat format: http://www.ucei.berkeley.edu/ucei/pdf/pwp063.pdf stakeholders throughout the united states are currently working to reach a consensus on the structure and protocols that will define tradable transmission rights in the context of the various wholesale electricity markets, and their associated independent system operators (isos), now forming in different regions of the u.s.  much of the discussion has focused on the relative merits of physical transmission rights in comparison with financial transmission rights.   to the extent that transmission rights provide their owners with an added level of influence or control over transmission markets, some of the historical industry concerns over vertical market power may need to be revisited.   in this paper, i discuss some of the potential concerns over transmission rights and their use for the exercise of various forms of market power. download this paper in adobe acrobat format: http://www.ucei.berkeley.edu/ucei/pdf/pwp062.pdf most of the literature concerned with decentralized operations in power grids has focussed on partitioning systems initially into two main parts, and asking how the actions of these two subgroups can be properly coordinated.  while a number of studies have gone on to examine decentralized operations in the user market of producers and consumers, little attention has been given to how the operation of the transmission system itself might be decentralized.  in this paper we propose an organizational procedure for coordinating the actions of the managers of given subgrids of a larger system.  non-invasive price-quantity dialogs are defined that, under fairly

"i am not sure i understand your second paragraph.  if pg&e reduces going-forward procurement costs to reflect ferc-ordered refunds, i do not understand why it would affect already-issued ctc charges.  the cost of power would be cheaper going forward. thanks for the thoughts.  i fully agree on bf costs and dwr costs.  i believe that you are right on est rt$ = caisom imbalance, but i need to check. on the question of retroactive ratemaking, it is my understanding that you are correct.  pg&e probably won't rebill, but will need to put in place an adjustment to the going forward px credit to ""collect"" the overpayment of negative ctc. jim i assume that if an hourly px market clearing price is mitigated per a ferc order it would affect variable ""hc"" in the formula laid out in the attachment. it is not clear to me which  variable represents hourly iso imbalance energy costs, but i assume its ""est rt$"".  if i am right, that variable would be affected by  the mitigated market price (mmp) for caiso imbalance energy. my comments are: the ferc is able to only order refunds to jurisdictional entities and, given appeals, it may take years before the full extent of thre refunds are known.  therefore there will be a significant difference between the change in the mitigated market price (mmp) as declared by ferc and the px credit.  that is, a 10% reduction in the mmp should not be construed as having a 10% effect on the px credit, assuming it can be recalculated at all.  specifically, only some of the ""hc"" or  ""est rt$""  costs can  be adjusted per ferc refund orders. also, the px credit is a tariffed rate.  i do not believe the pu code allows for retroactive adjustments to tariffed rates unless there was an explicit cost tracking account (e.g. a balancing a/c).  to my knowledge, no such account exists here.   finally, i do not see a relationship between mmps and (1) block forward costs on any date and (2) pg&e and/or dwr's procurement costs for the net short position post january 19.  so, those px credit costs should be unaffected by any ferc refund order. alan comnes thanks. jim",0

""i would  cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says 'hi my name is spike,  honey,' "" adds mr. lockyer. houston-based enron is a major energy-trading  company. like other such firms, enron has denied wrongdoing in the california  market. mark palmer, enron's vice president for corporate communications, said mr.  lockyer's comment about mr. lay "" is so counterproductive that it doesn't  merit a response."" investigators and academics say there is abundant evidence that individual  firms have been exercising ""market power."" this term is used to denote  efforts to influence wholesale-electricity prices, such as by withholding  supplies. the california independent system operator, or iso, which manages  the state's electric transmission grid, estimates that by exercising market  power, suppliers may have added about $6.8 billion to the cost of electricity  in the state since early last year. a single firm exercising such power isn't necessarily illegal, says severin  borenstein, director of the university of california energy institute. if a  company is a large supplier in the state and ""you're not exercising market  power, you are not doing your job"" on behalf of shareholders, he says. mr. borenstein and others say that there are steps that should be taken  against suppliers. they note that under federal power law, the federal energy  regulatory commission can order refunds for wholesale prices that are above  ""just and reasonable"" levels. so far, ferc has tentatively ordered california  suppliers to make tens of millions of dollars of such refunds, as part of  that agency's ongoing inquiry into the california market. critics of the  suppliers and ferc say the refunds should be in the billions of dollars. the power industry, not surprisingly, says there is nothing to accusations of  price manipulation or collusion. executives point to a botched  state-utility-deregulation plan that relies heavily on volatile spot-market  purchases. suppliers note that over the past decade, california didn't build  enough new power plants to keep up with demand growth. the allegations of  manipulation are ""a lot of sound and fury and they won't produce anything,""  says gary ackerman, executive director of the western power trading forum, an  industry trade group. investigations aplenty in the year since california's energy deregulation plan began resulting in  higher prices and even blackouts, a flurry of investigations has gotten under  way. here are the main ones: federal energy regulatory commission ????whether generators are charging more  than ""just and reasonable"" rates as demanded by the federal power act;  whether el paso corp. used its position as a major natural-gas supplier to  the state to illegally drive up the price of fuel used to generate  electricity.  california public utilities commission and the state attorney general  ????whether generators and power traders have acted illegally through  collusion or other means to artificially inflate electricity prices.  puc and california independent system operator ????whether generation plants  were shut down for spurious reasons in order to create supply shortages and,  thus, to raise electricity prices.  california electricity oversight board ????whether patterns of bidding and  pricing in california's electricity auction indicate collusive or otherwise  illegal behavior.  sources: state and federal agencies power generators also point to sharp increases in some of their costs,  particularly natural gas, which is a major power-plant fuel. this rise in  natural-gas prices also has set off a flurry of investigations over possible  of probes by federal and state officials. el paso denies any wrongdoing. while power-industry officials say they have been cooperating with the  investigations, law-enforcement officials say they have hit some roadblocks.  for instance, mr. lockyer's office has gone to san francisco state court to  enforce subpoenas against reliant, houston-based dynegy inc. and southern co.  and mirant corp., both of atlanta, after the companies resisted turning over  certain business documents they deemed confidential. investigators have zeroed in on the increased frequency with which plants are  going out of service for unscheduled outages. at times, several thousand  fewer megawatts of capacity are available than a year ago. a thousand  megawatts can power about one million homes. 'forced outage' rate rises generators say that this increased ""forced outage"" rate shows that tight  supplies over the past year have required them to run plants, some of them  more than 40 years old, for long periods without routine maintenance. this  combination has produced more breakdowns. ""plants have been running flat  out,"" says tom williams, a spokesman for duke energy co., charlotte, n.c.,  which says that its california power plants produced 50% more electricity in  at the same time, during periods of lower demand, the number of unplanned  outages often seems to rise enough to keep supplies tight, says frank wolak,  a stanford university professor and chairman of the iso's market surveillance  committee. ""clearly, something is going on here."" however, he and others say  that it is almost impossible to tell why a particular pipe failed or whether  such a failure was a legitimate reason to reduce output. some of the most intriguing evidence to date about forced outages surfaced in  a federal case. ferc officials said an investigation had raised questions  about whether two major power companies had taken plants out of service in  order to reap higher electricity prices. the charges against aes corp.,  arlington, va., which owns the plants, and williams cos., tulsa, okla., which  markets their output, asserted that those actions allowed the companies to  in one instance, according to case filings, a williams employee ""indicated""  to aes officials that his firm wouldn't financially penalize aes for  extending an outage at one plant. this conversation, which was voluntarily  divulged by williams, could be an indication of collusion. williams and aes  settled the case without admitting any wrongdoing by paying back $8 million  to the iso and by taking certain other measures. a williams spokeswoman says  the employee who talked to aes was ""counseled not to enter into any  conversations of that nature"" in the future. another issue raised by the ferc case touched on maintenance procedures.  according to the filings, aes stopped doing a certain procedure to keep its  plant's cooling system from getting clogged. the clogging of the system was  cited as a reason for one of the forced outages. mark woodruff, president of  the aes unit that operates the plant in question, says the company  substituted what it felt was an equally effective maintenance procedure. if someone was looking to keep supplies tight and prices high, changes in  maintenance procedures would be an easy way to ensure that plants,  particularly old ones, have frequent forced outages, says a senior  utility-industry executive. by restricting maintenance resources, he says, an  operator can simply allow a plant ""to take itself out of service."" write to john r. emshwiller at  copyright 2001 knight ridder/tribune news service section: state and regional news headline:

firsthand from city officials about how an advance notification program can work. state lawmakers are exploring ways to provide californians with greater notice of potential blackouts, including scheduling them in advance. ??in chicago, where aging lines and structural limitations have produced a string of power outages over the past two summers, residents often receive 30 minutes warning a blackout is coming, and grid operators work with city  agencies and police to ensure criminals don't take advantage of the opportunity. ??california's new warning system has considerable limits. ??the iso, after all, does not determine where blackouts occur. they simply tell the three utilities in the system _ pacific gas & electric, southern california edison and san diego gas & electric _ when to shut off power and  how much to turn off. ??it is up to the utilities to determine where the blackouts occur. who knows their block number could use information from pg&e and the iso websites to prepare for a blackout. ??pg&e spokesman john nelson said the northern california utility can make  tens of thousands of phone calls to businesses and customers who need power for life-support systems and other medical necessities ""in a very short period of time."" ??""we think that anything that increases the amount of time that we're given  by the iso . . . is a good thing,"" nelson said, adding that at the beginning of this year the utility was assuming that it would get about 30 minutes notice before blackouts were ordered. ??in another development on monday, state controller kathleen

""they couldn't take notes from my lecture because they didn't understand the vocabulary. that bothers me a lot. who's going to inherit this country?"" ??seay, who recently moved to los angeles from miami, said he is troubled by the air pollution and racial tension he has encountered here. seay is african american and his wife is italian, he said, and their 9-year-old daughter is ""stuck half-and-half,"" caught in what seay regards as a troubling black-white divide.

edison has six in central and southern california.  ??the puc then finds the average amount of electricity use for customers  within each region. the baseline quantity is 50 percent to 60 percent of that amount, and up to 70 percent of that amount during the winter months if a customer  uses only one type of energy (electricity or natural gas). ??customers who depend on electronic medical equipment such as suction, breathing and dialysis machines, can apply for a slightly higher baseline. ??a family living in the scorching hot coachella valley would have a larger allotment of lower-priced electricity than a family living in breezy monterey, given that air conditioning for the former is necessary to survival. ??since baseline is based on averages, a single apartment dweller and a family of four who live in the same region could have the same baseline. that makes  it more likely for the family to get hit with rate hikes and less likely, economists fear, that the apartment dweller has a financial incentive to conserve. ??""where it is imperfect is that it has no ability to make any adjustments for the size of the family,"" said john nelson, a pg&e spokesman. ??focusing baseline on household size gets complicated, florio said. ""does  ??along with raising $5.7 billion to replenish the state's general fund for power buys since january, the rate hikes approved march 27 by the puc and allocated on tuesday were also meant to trigger conservation that could help avoid rolling blackouts this summer. loretta lynch and fellow commissioner wood say they may hold hearings as early as this coming week on possible inequities and ways to update the system. ??""there was plenty of testimony at public hearings that people suspect that baselines are not appropriate or are not calculated right,"" wood said. ??wood said when baseline first was created nearly 20 years ago, houses were smaller and many lacked central air conditioning. ??though the puc has updated baseline amounts through the years, ""living standards have changed, housing standards have changed and it may be that average usage is different from what it was,"" wood said. ??florio said giving baselines a second look could go either way for  consumers. there are typically more electronic gadgets in homes these days, but many of those gadgets and appliances are more energy efficient than their ancestors. ??add that to increased conservation statewide, florio said, and there's a  slim chance baselines could actually go down and expose more customers to rate  hikes. ??""it's a percentage of average use historically, and people have used energy more efficiently,"" through the years, florio said. ??california public utilities commission: http://www.cpuc.ca.gov ??pacific gas and electric co.: http://www.pge.com ??southern california edison co.: http://www.sce.com the materials in the ap file were compiled by the associated press. ?these materials may not be republished without the express written consent of the associated press. section: state and regional headline: new poll suggests californians haven't been this gloomy for years dateline: san francisco body: in the wrong direction. economy to worsen in the next year, while about 40 percent see a brighter horizon, according to a new poll. early may by the nonpartisan public policy institute of california. the poll  was conducted in english and spanish. ??the twin culprits were the souring economy and the electricity crisis. ??""californians clearly see the electricity crisis as a harbinger of other growth-related problems,"" said mark baldassare, the research institute's  survey director.

??with three power plants down for repairs last week when temperatures spiked, large customers in eastern iowa were notified their electricity would be cut off. headlines proclaimed a ""crisis,"" and legislative leaders shifted into an  told you so"" mode. ??this is not california. there is no crisis. customers with interruptible consumption or when generators are down. ??it may not be fair to suggest that alliant energy chose to idle three of its biggest generators to make the case for changing the law, but the timing is nonetheless convenient. the legislature is set to convene a special session  few weeks, and among the business left over from the regular session could be  a bill to make it easier for power companies to build electric generating  plants. ??while crisis is not imminent, iowa does face the prospect of consuming more electricity than the state's utilities are able to generate themselves. ... a special session, that should not be the end of the matter. ultimately, the legislature must fashion a long-range energy policy for this state that takes  a regional view of energy, that reflects new market and regulation realities,  and that seizes the potential for conservation and renewable alternatives to  fossil fuels. ??legislative session: ??telegraph herald does it always seem the big-ticket items are pushed through in the final days? ??this year's session started out strong, passing a bill to save taxpayers money by eliminating the sales tax on residential utility bills. it finished  up by coming through with $40 million for teachers' pay. there was plenty of hand-wringing about the budget shortfall, the usual banter about dove hunting and a fair amount of partisan bickering. ... open records law. the way it stands now, a governmental body can use a private contractor to investigate problems within the department and keep that contractor's report confidential under the law's whistle-blower provision. ... ??-the legislature didn't want to get into a full-blown gambling debate, so it didn't address a tax freeze at racetracks. ... the issue of fairness needs to  be addressed. ??floating casinos pay a 20 percent tax, while racetracks pay a gradually ??-other things that legislators talked about but didn't get around to  include: cutting state income tax on social security income and a pair of bills addressing the state's bottle-deposit law. jobs ??-amend the open records law. allowing agencies to keep information about government activities secret simply because it is in the possession of an outside contractor is a hole in the law that needs to be fixed. will have been a waste if the program is left hanging unfunded. ??-freeze the amount of tax racetracks pay where it stands and stop the hemorrhaging of dollars into state coffers. the disparity between racetracks  and riverboat casinos needs to be righted. ??and if they're worried that the discussion will draw an all-out gambling debate, lawmakers might want to bring it to the table before may. ??we agree with gov. tom vilsack that the new state budget approved by legislators ""will cause hardship for people and families across our state."" don't have as much money as you wanted. ??on the contrary, vilsack got what he said all along would be the high mark  of pay. ??and the republican-led legislature also agreed to phase out the sales tax on utilities, long a goal of vilsack's democratic party. ??is it the best we likely can do under the circumstances? yes. ??vilsack should sign budget legislation, rather than vetoing it and calling a special session of the legislature this summer. ... ??plant sciences institute: ??des moines register: ??iowa needs more people, especially young people. iowa needs more jobs that pay well - the kinds of jobs that cause other businesses, small and large, to spring up here. so why did iowa lawmakers blow the single best opportunity for both? ??they blame it on a tight budget. blame them for failing to grasp the big picture. the fledgling plant sciences institute at iowa state university could become a major force in the fast-growing field of biotechnology related to agriculture - yet the 2001 legislature provided no new money. million, a meager increase proposed by the governor. it allowed isu to keep money from the sale of land, with proceeds to be used for the institute's roy  j. million in cash. ... ??because of legislative inaction, promising initiatives must slow down, or  may never take place. ... ??the institute had hoped to hire another top researcher in the field of corn genomics ... ??ag-biotech companies have been appealing to the state for help putting together a protein-extraction facility ... such a facility might extract  protein from conventional or genetically modified plants for such uses as pharmaceuticals, food additives or chemical enzymes for industrial processes. the plant sciences institute has a small, pilot protein-extraction facility.  new money from the legislature would have allowed it to assist businesses in establishing a commercial facility. but now? ""the people interested in this  will probably go elsewhere,"" said director stephen howell. ??why wouldn't they? plenty of other states are serious about fostering  biotech industries. the iowa commitment is hardly encouraging. ... ??iowa has a budget crunch because its economy and population are not growing fast enough. investing in biotechnology - the technology that is expected to drive the next great wave of economic growth - is the most promising way to  make iowa's economy and population grow. stinting on that investment is stunningly shortsighted. ??ten million dollars next session should not be out of the question. the question should be what sort of future will iowa have if it does not make the most of the potential the plant sciences institute holds. ??hunting requirements: ??in april, the iowa house and senate rejected a measure that would have required wild turkey hunters to report their harvest to the department of natural resources, saying it was ""just another hassle,"" for hunters. percent. a non-resident who wants to hunt deer in iowa under this plan will  have to shell out $308, including a hunting license and habitat fee. the current we don't much care about managing our wildlife and we don't want you here,  either. add to the mix a federal whammy in the freedom to farm act, which has all but eliminated any fence rows, and hunting as a potential tourism draw to iowa  blows away in the wind. ... ??instead of having accurate information on how much hunting is affecting turkey populations, department of natural resources wildlife managers are now left to guess. ... ??surrounding states which capitalize on their resources require even more harvest registration, and it hasn't slowed interest. ... ??the dnr asked for the fee increases for good reasons - license fees have not increased for a decade while the costs of salaries, travel and equipment have begun to eat into funds available for facilities and land acquisition. and  we're in favor of using fees to support wildlife management. is ??but some fee hikes were too much. ??in particular, the non-resident fees for deer hunting are high especially in comparison to surrounding states, and are more than most ordinary people are likely to pay. wisconsin charges non-residents $135 to hunt deer. missouri in, not more. what out-of-state hunter will be drawn to iowa when surrounding  states are managing their herds better and charging less to visit? ??iowa worries that the farm economy is in the tank. we wring our hands as our young people rush to other parts of the country. we say that our natural resources here can be an attraction that will draw people back. yet these  votes run counter to sound wildlife management and increased tourism. ??public official recruits: ??more iowa school districts and local governments are using professional companies to help find high-level administrators such as superintendents, but that recruiting tool is making the process less accountable to the public. ??in effect, it allows private firms to dictate public policy, and that's troubling. ??one example of this trend is the camanche school district, where six finalists for the superintendents job were in town for interviews recently.  they met with school board members, district staff and some residents, yet the  board does not intend to reveal the names of the candidates. the cedar rapids headhunter firm that has contracted with the district advised the school board not to announce the names. ??headhunters also are advising candidates to request their names be kept confidential. under iowa law, a public entity such as a school board must  honor such a request. ??some public officials justify this secrecy by arguing that finalists don't want the public to know if they didn't get the job offer or worry that identification may jeopardize their current position. ... ??those arguments aren't justified, for reasons including: ??-there is nothing dishonorable in not being chosen for a top-level post. indeed, being considered a finalist for such a job may serve only to enhance a candidates attractiveness for another position ... ??-identifying the finalists for the public also allows citizens to ask questions and provide other information, critical or supportive, that could be useful in helping officials make a final choice. ??-and being upfront with the public lends credibility to the entire process ... ??we prefer a process similar to one used by the city of clinton during its recent search for a city administrator. the five finalists were not only identified, they took part in an open house to meet the public. a headhunter firm was used, but city attorney bruce johansen, himself a candidate who did  not get the job, said he made it clear to the agency that the finalists names  should be made public. ??we applaud that effort ... ??meanwhile, the iowa legislature this spring modified a state law that has been the basis of confidentiality claims for candidates seeking public positions. the change would require that official communication between  private contractors and the public entities they serve be open to public inspection. whether that law will be interpreted to include headhunter firms remains to be seen. ... ??we encourage school boards and local governments to resist confidentiality and test the new law when it takes effect july 1. ??cedar rapids gazette: ??who'd have thought that the selection of the secretary of the federal department of human services last winter might affect whether davenport, iowa city and des moines get rail service. ??but consider that hhs secretary tommy thompson, who resigned recently from the amtrak board, had been a strong advocate of expanded rail service here in the midwest while he was governor of wisconsin. thompson had hoped to remain chairman of the amtrak board after he went to washington. but the associated press reports that a 1997 law that restructured the amtrak board says only one administration wants transportation secretary norman mineta on the governing board. ??few people around are as passionate as thompson about amtrak, and iowa could have benefited. it's hard to ride a national passenger train service that doesn't go where the majority of iowans live. maybe the service will be  expanded here. but maybe, with the changes in the governing board, that train has  already left the station. ??smoker identification: ??have you heard the news from walgreen's? they're going to card everybody who wants to buy a package of cigarettes, a box of cigars, a can of chew. ??that can't have been an easy decision. within a year, they're looking at software that will require clerk's to enter a customer's birth date into a computer before a tobacco sale can be completed. until then, they're asking their clerks to card everybody. good for them. ... ??yes, it will take a little extra time ... evidently, the owners/corporate bigwigs think the time is well spent if it eliminates the fines and bad publicity. ??a convenience store association spokesman told reporters that other stores are likely to duplicate walgreen's efforts. yes. we certainly hope so. ??we all have heard terrible numbers of deaths caused by tobacco, of underage users ... many, if not most of us, know someone who hacks and coughs, who died from smoking, who cries because someone died from smoking. when you think of them, it doesn't seem so outrageous to card everyone. it seems downright brilliant. ... ??it won't stop it entirely. young wanna-be-smokers will have somebody older  do the buying, or swipe a carton. there will always be a way to get around it, there always is. ??still, carding everyone says, ""this is important, we mean it and we're not going to make it easy for you."" content and programming copyright 2001 cnbc/dow jones business video, a  division ??of cnbc/dow jones desktop video, llc. no portions of the

section: business guests: robert glynn byline: mark haines, joe battipaglia may be updated. mark haines, cnbc anchor, squawk box: one company that is hurting a lot in all this is pg&e, the parent of pacific gas and electric. they filed for chapter  bankruptcy in april. pg&e has about $9 billion in unrecovered power costs. a california bankruptcy judge says the company cannot raise retail rates to  recoup those losses. the stock is on a steep decline this year, trading in the 52  week joining us to tell us where things are now and where they could be going, robert glynn, pg&e's chairman and ceo. mr. glynn, good to see you again. robert glynn, chairman & ceo, pg&e: good morning, mark. glynn: well, we're working our way through the federal bankruptcy proceeding, where we affirmatively stepped in order to resolve issues between ourselves  and our creditors. we have a plan of reorganization under development and we're getting close to the time when we can begin to share that plan with the creditors who, after all, need to get paid. haines: so let's first talk about time. how much time do you think this might take before pg&e emerges from bankruptcy? glynn: well, it's very hard to tell for one reason. there have not been very many utility bankruptcies and i don't know of any that has had these complexities to it. the shortest possible time or shortest likely time that  heard about has been six to eight months and that's probably shorter than it will take. the longest that i've heard about is about four years and that's an awful lot longer than i want it to take. haines: in the meantime you are selling electricity, transmitting and selling electricity on a retail level. are you still losing money on your operating? glynn: well, the potential area for continuing loss exposure is the issue of whether the california independent system operator is still buying on behalf  of our company instead of buying directly on behalf of our customers. and that's  an issue that's before the federal energy regulatory commission for decision  making right now. haines: well, i guess my question is who is paying the bills right now? glynn: well, the electric rates in california have just been raised by the california public utilities commission in order to have the state, the department of water resources be able to recover all of its costs because  that's what, of course, it wants to do. it doesn't want to go any deeper in debt than it has to. so this most recent large rate increase has applied, as best as we can tell, exclusively to cover the state's cost increases and not to cover  some of the ones that we're responsible for. joe battipaglia: mr. glynn, the brownouts continue in california. what's the status of supply of electricity into the state, putting aside for a moment how glynn: well, the california electricity crisis at its heart is a supply shortage and the outlook for this summer and next summer are pretty bleak.  every responsible entity that has reviewed the situation is forecasting that there will be a large number of rolling blackouts occurring over the summer of 2001 around. battipaglia: does that spread from california to other states as the draw down becomes perilous? glynn: well, the california electricity market and the pacific northwest markets have had a very nice symbiotic relationship over many, many years shipping power back and forth to one another. that has been interrupted  because of the supply shortage in california, which means that california is trying to be a net importer all the time. and it seems like the pacific northwest won't have the kind of surplus energy to send south to california that it's had in  the past. haines: does this ultimately end with retail electricity distribution transmission and distribution being done by a state authority and no longer by privately held or publicly held companies? glynn: i don't think it ends there at all, mark. and i certainly don't think that it's in the state's interest to try to get into businesses that can be  done by private capital when the state has so many other important things to use  its capital on, like education and infrastructure. and i do think that this supply shortage has got to be resolved. it's got to be resolved by building new  supply. there's simply no alternative to that and that's going to take another couple  of years before that new construction is fully completed. haines: all right, sir. thank you very much for the update. we appreciate it. robber glynn, pg&e's chairman and ceo. end section: news; domestic

?it recommends that israel resume paying the money that's collected in taxes back to the palestinian authority. ?it recommends a whole range of action, many of them to be taken by israel, which the reports says would help bring the tone back to where it  needs to be, would help bring the two sides back to where they could once again be negotiating instead of shooting at each other and letting off bombs. however, for him to get involved in shuttle diplomacy. ?he wants first to have ambassador burns and the others come up with recommendations over the next  week, two weeks or three, and then he and the president will try to figure out where the u.s. can go from here. middle east. ?they are now engaging somewhat, because they're so concerned about the situation out there, judy. ??woodruff: david, the report, the mitchell report, suggesting that the israelis more responsible here, or at least that they have more to do in order to get things back on the peace track than the palestinians? ensor: the report is very even-handed. ?it doesn't blame either side for the situation. ?it, for example, does not blame ariel sharon's visit to the temple mount for the following intifada, intifada ii it's been called. ?but it says that there  needs to be a series of actions by both sides to bring down the tensions, and if you look at the list of what it's asking for, there are more steps that the  israelis would have to take than the palestinians. ??woodruff: and david, why is it that the administration is saying at this in an energetically involved way the way the clinton administration was? ??ensor: well, i think the administration, this administration, feels that the thing a little bit. ?it was too much presidential involvement and it was too much of a day-to-day hand-holding operation. ?they feel they need to hold back a little bit and try to get the parties to talk to each other. ??however, the situation is deteriorating pretty rapidly, and so now they realize they have to have some greater involvement. ?and that's why ambassador burns has been asked to prepare these recommendation, judy. ??woodruff: all right. ?david ensor reporting for us from the state  department. ??for more on the middle east conflict, stay with us for a special half-hour ??now, we turn to questions about the bush administration's political fund-raising tactics. ?tonight, vice president dick cheney is scheduled to  host spokeswoman for the democrats says that that event smacks of, in her words, hypocrisy. ??the democrats say the reception at the vice president's home is comparable  to clinton-era events, such as white house coffees and lincoln bedroom sleepovers for big donors, which drew heavy criticism from republicans. ?among them: presidential candidate george w. bush. oval office desk to the buck stops here on the lincoln bedroom. ?and that's not  good conduct ourselves in office. there's a huge trust. ?i see it all the time when ??and we can do better than the past administration has done. ??woodruff: despite that sort of criticism then, the republicans are defending their fund-raising tactics now. ?senate majority leader trent lott had this to say about the reception for big donors at vice president cheney's home  tonight. there's any question, i'd suggest you address it to them. ?unfortunately, i voting, giving tax relief. ??woodruff: virtually all of those gop contributors, who will mingle with vice republican national committee. ?they will also attend a major rnc fund-raiser tomorrow night that features president bush as the main speaker and is  expected ??now let's bring in our white house correspondent, major garrett. ??major, tell us about what this event is about tomorrow night. ??major garrett, cnn correspondent: well, it's the first official republican national committee event to honor the president and the first lady, as you  said. the targeted haul is $15 million. republican national committee officials tell republican party has held for years and years in washington. ??as for what's happening in the vice president's residence tonight, white house press secretary ari fleischer told me this is a way of saying ""thank  you,"" in his words, ""to those republicans who,"" as ari fleischer said, ""did so much  to help win the selection."" ??and he draws a distinction with the clinton-era coffees and sleepovers, describing them as, quote, ""organized schemes to bring people through the  gates of the white house to get money or to persuade others to do so."" ??mark minor, who is the communications director for the republican national committee, also said that no one paid to go to the vice president's residence. no checks will pass between hands there. there is no quid pro quo, and that  some people who will be at the vice president's residence tonight are not in fact  rnc ??woodruff: so, major, again, clarify the distinction between money events  that are given as a thank you and events that are given as an encouragement to give more money. ??garrett: well, it's a distinction this white house wants to draw as clearly as it possibly can. ?in the words of ari fleischer, thanking someone, whether it's on government property or not on government property, is a completely legitimate activity for the president or the vice president to engage in. ?the distinction he is drawing is that during the clinton era people were brought  to the white house, to these coffees, and as was disclosed in the thompson report that was conducted by the senate investigating that, there was some evidence  of actually targeted lists: that people who were brought in, money was described  to bringing in for a coffee. ?a certain dollar amount was attached to donations  to the democratic national committee, a larger amount if they, in fact, slept  here at the white house in the lincoln bedroom. ?that is the key distinction, the republicans say: that there is no targeting necessarily of these people to  come to the vice president's residence. ??they also point out that the original letters inviting these big donors to washington did not in any way suggest there would be a reception at the vice president's residence: the point there being these people donated without any expectation of having dinner or reception with lynne cheney and dick cheney in the vice president's home. vice president's, how many are they saying did not give money? ??garrett: they're not disclosing any numbers. ?they're only saying that some have given. ?they clearly and readily acknowledge that. ?some are lobbyists. some represent large corporations. ?but others, they say, are just republican don't have any numbers for you on that, though. ??woodruff: all right, major garrett reporting at the white house. thank you very much. ??vice president cheney maybe taking some heat for fund-raising tactics, not  to mention his role in creating the bush energy plan. look that this: ??our new poll shows cheney's job approval rating is 4 points higher than the presidents. ?while mr. bush's approval rating has held pretty steady in the  past couple of weeks, he has lost ground since late april. ?cheney's approval  rating has dipped as well. ??for more on mr. bush's ratings and how they relate to his policies, we are joined now by our senior political analyst bill schneider. ??tell us, bill, which of mr. bush's policies is the most popular? ??william schneider, cnn senior political analyst: well, you might guess you would be wrong. ??because, what americans like best is the tax cut. ?two thirds of the public now favors a substantial tax cut. ?that's up from 60 percent earlier this  month. well, why not? ?what's wrong with getting some money back from the government? ??actually, most people do not think the tax cut could benefit them much financially. ?they like it because they believe it will help the economy. ?and that is why so many democrats find it very difficult to oppose. actually divided over the president's energy plan. ?why? ?it's not because the public blames the bush administration for the nation's energy problems. ?most people blame the oil companies. ??in fact, more people blame congress and the clinton administration and environmental laws and american consumers than blame the bush administration. but most americans still give president bush low marks on energy. ?the core americans say president bush is not doing enough to solve the country's energy problems. americans believe the plan will help the nation's energy problem immediately. most people think oh, it will help, but only after several years. ?it's a long-run solution. ?americans want help now. ?right now. ?with electricity in california. ?and with gas prices all over the country. ?long-term solutions  are important, but politics is a short-term business. ?if the problem is now,  people want results now. gasoline now. ??schneider: because they think this administration is run by oilmen. ?oilmen ??by nearly two to one, the public believes energy companies have too much influence over the bush administration's policies. ?in fact, americans are  split when you ask them whether the bush energy plan is designed to further the country's interests or the energy companies' interests. ?that sounds like breathtaking cynicism. ?but any administration that's run by texas oilmen is automatically suspect. ??woodruff: all right, bill schneider, thank you very much. you're not  suspect. ??schneider: i am certainly not. ??do californians blame president bush for their energy crisis? we've heard a little bit from bill on that. ?that answer and more on the issue later this ??just what kind of tax cut is the senate considering? ?jonathan karl crunches the numbers. ?also: ??unidentified male: we have no ability to bring up the amendments. ?you don't set the agenda every day, and that is real power in the house. ??woodruff: the trials and tribulations of the minority leader, as he  considers the present and the future. ?and later: ??rewarding a president's most controversial decision. ?a political ""profile  in courage."" all ahead on inside politics. ??woodruff: president bush today donned the traditional commencement robes,  and gave the graduating class at yale university a few bits of advice. ?the president also included a glimpse at his less-than-perfect college years. ?as cnn's kelly wallace reports, today's speech was a departure from how the president's dealt with his alma mater in the past. ??kelly wallace, cnn white house correspondent (voice-over): a homecoming of sorts, george w. bush who has only been back to his alma mater once since yale's graduating class. ??i say, you too, can be president of the united states. ??wallace: the president offering a self-deprecating account of his days as  the undergraduate, when, as a history major, he earned modest grades and was known more as a fraternity boy prankster than a rising political star. ??the visit was not without controversy, with some students protesting and  some professors boycotting, charging that mr. bush was not yet deserving of an honorary degree. ??peter brooks, yale university professor: it doesn't seem at present to represent the intellectual ideals and the service to humanity in which we  think that yale stands for. ??wallace: the president has kept his distance from this ivy league  institution for most of his political life, painting it as a symbol of elitism, even  during respond well to are people who are snobs, whether you are a social snob or an intellectual snob or any other kind of snob. ??wallace: mr. bush rarely mentions what he did on this day, that he was born in new haven when his dad, the former president, was an undergraduate at yale. texas. ?from there, yale always seemed a world away. ??wallace: the president, for years, had been miffed with yale for not  awarding it appears now, all is forgiven. current student, seems very proud that yale is a part of his past. ??kelly wallace, cnn, new haven, connecticut. he will explore seeking the democratic presidential nomination. ?the civil rights activist said yesterday that the party did not protect the rights of disenfranchised voters in florida in the last presidential race. ??if he runs, sharpton said that he would promote issues that concern blacks and progressives, and his effort would not be just symbolic. ?sharpton ran city ??reverend sharpton and former republican presidential candidate gary bauer will discuss president bush's faith-based plan to help the poor tonight on ??another note from new york: a state supreme court justice today barred rudy giuliani's girlfriend from the mayor's official residence, gracie mansion.  judge ruled in favor of giuliani's estranged wife, donna hanover, who had requested a restraining order barring judith nathan from the residence. ?the ruling says that nathan may not enter the residence as long as the giuliani children continue to live there. ?the judge also denied giuliani's second attempt for a gag order in the couple's divorce proceedings. ??and we'll have the latest on president bush's tax cut when we come back. ??(commercial break) woodruff: this evening, the senate is expected to vote on the latest version of the now $1.35 trillion tax cut plan. ?republican leaders hope to give president bush the tax cut for approval before memorial day. ?but as jonathan karl reports, taxpayers will have a longer wait before reaping any of the measure's benefits. ??jonathan karl, cnn congressional correspondent (voice-over): the senate's your tax windfall yet. ?most of the cuts will not take effect for several  years to come. bush is re-elected, it wouldn't take effect until two years after he completed his increasing the ??sen. charles grassley (r-ia), finance committee chairman: you are right,  some relief to wait until next year. couples filing jointly, but just how that money gets back to taxpayers is  still to be worked out. ?the option favored by the president is a simple rebate  check sent directly to taxpayers, an idea opposed by many senate republicans who  call it impractical. ??but the rebate would represent a fraction of the overall tax cut, which democratic opponents say will explode in cost after it's fully phased in two years from now. means simply that it is disguised in terms of its full cost. ?this decade it trillion. ??karl: but there's a little noticed provision of this tax cut that may make that point moot. ?the tax cut includes a sunset provision, that means all the remain in place, congress would have to pass them again. ??karl: now, the senate is expected to vote on a series of amendments to the tax cut later on today, paving the way for a final vote on the tax cut here in the senate tonight. ?but it will not end there. ?this still needs to be reconciled with the tax cut that was passed in house, the house passing almost exactly the president's tax cut, including much deeper cuts in income tax  rates preferred by republicans. ??the senate and the house will have to work out their differences. they're expected to do so this week, setting the stage to send this final tax cut down the president was talking about when he said the tax cut would help people  with higher gasoline prices? talking about, directing the money right into the hands of taxpayers, directly into the hands of those people paying higher gasoline prices at the pumps. ??this is an idea that his treasury secretary, paul o'neill, strongly favors, the idea of direct cash payments or check payments to taxpayers. ?but one big problem with this, judy, is that taxpayers over the course of time move, they change addresses, some of them die. the question is, how do you make sure you get all the right checks to those people at current addresses? ?it's not an  easy proposition. solicitor general of the united states has run into a real problem in the  senate committee. ?where does that stand right now? ?the last we heard, the senate judiciary had split 9-9 on the nomination of ted olson. ??karl: well, the senate leaders, trent lott and tom daschle, are now actively involved in this, trying to come to some kind of an agreement, an agreement  that will allow the democrats to get access to some information they want about olson, especially information that was compiled by independent council robert ray, looking to just what olson's involvement was in that arkansas project by the ""american spectator"" magazine, the investigation into bill clinton's personal life. ??they want information from the independent council to look at just how involved olson was in that project, to see whether or not he was truthful in  his testimony when he said he was not very involved at all. ?there's some movement to try to get the democrats on the committee more of the information, also  maybe to release more of it to the public. nomination before the full senate, but probably not until after memorial day. ?the senate goes on recess at the end of the week, they will be off all of next week, you probably won't see a vote on the olson nomination until after they return. ??woodruff: all right, jon karl at the capitol, thanks. in the house of representatives, democrats are finding themselves drowned out by the  republican majority. ?add to that, critics who say the party is lacking leadership and strategy. ?and life in the house minority begins to look bleak. ?our kate snow caught up with the house minority leader dick gephardt to talk about the  balance of power and his political future. for, and that's what... ??kate snow, cnn congressional correspondent (voice-over): dick gephardt will tell you it's frustrating being a democrat these days, stuck in the minority without the backing of the white house. hard as you can, and if you really believe in it, then you're frustrated if you're not able to those policies through. ??snow: gephardt says the democrats are forced to play defense, responding to republicans. deficits out there in the future won't be so large. ?i think we cooperated with the president on the educational bill, at least the substance of it, but we still haven't been able to convince him or the republicans to put enough money into education to really make the program happen. ??on energy, i think that we've got a very, very positive alternative that i hope people will listen to. ?people in california and oregon and washington  need help now. capitol the next day, and then in a underground war room. ??gephardt is a master at staying on message, often spending hours talking to the press, his strategy: agree with republicans when he thinks they're right  and hammer at home when he disagrees. is a mistake that we will pay for for years to come. there are times when you need to show your emotion. ?you need to let people  know that you really care about this. ?and you really want the country to go in a different direction. ?and i think you can't appear too tentative or too laid back or too uninterested. ??i have talked to some democrats who say that they are truly unhappy. some of whom say that they are unhappy with your leadership. ?they don't feel that you're doing an effective job. ?do you feel that there is trouble within the ranks? party are largely unified. ?they are marching together and working together in we. ??i would never tell you that anybody is ever going to be pleased every day with everything that happens, but largely, i think that we've achieved real unity and real effectiveness in being the loyal opposition here in washington. election? important, not for the party and not for me, but for the country. legislatively for the next couple of years? really out of power totally in the house. ?you have no ability to bring up  amendments, you don't set the agenda every day. and that is real power in the house. do you have plans to run for president? ??gephardt: i really think that if you don't stay totally focused on the goal that is ahead of you, then you lessen your chances of reaching that goal. ?and usual in our system, we all want to look ahead and start calling the next race after that for president, but that is not what i'm doing and not what i should be doing. ??snow (voice-over): gephardt insists he's not planning ahead, though he's scheduled to attend four events in new hampshire in two weeks. ??gephardt: the future will take of itself. ?i have no idea what will happen, and i'm not worried about it, and i don't spend time worrying about it. ??gephardt: absolutely. ?i'm totally committed to winning this house back, and ??woodruff: kate snow talking with house minority leader dick gephardt. ?they talked today. ?and later this week, kate will sit down with house speaker  dennis hastert. ?you can look for that report on friday. ??on another term for the another high-profile republican and two nationally known democrats with apparent home state ambitions. ??inside politics will be right back. ??to no one's surprise, charlton heston was reelected today to an  unprecedented fourth term as president of the national rifle association. ?the 77-year-old actor was chosen at the nra's annual convention in kansas city. ?the group changed its rules last year to allow heston a third term, and a spokesman said there really wasn't much discussion by the board before deciding to elect him, once again. ??former attorney general janet reno may be looking for a new line of work. now back in her native florida, reno says she finds the idea of running for governor appealing. ??janet reno, former attorney general: i love florida very much. i was born  and that i do everything i can, either as governor or otherwise, to serve the interest  of the people of florida. ??woodruff: reno says she does not believe that her parkinson's disease would keep her from running, and she expects to make a decision before the end of  the year. ??governor jeb bush says possible opponents do not factor into his decision on whether to run for reelection. ??house minority whip david bonior may trade in his congressional seat for a run at the governor's mansion. ?the 13-term congressman from michigan filed  his aides say that a formal announcement will come later. ?with michigan slated to lose one house district, bonior's seat may be vulnerable to the state's republican controlled redistricting efforts. ?republican governor john engler cannot seek reelection because of term limits. ??californians and the energy crunch: are they pointing fingers at the president? ?we'll check new poll numbers from the golden state, and discuss power politics in the state when we return. californians say they disapprove of the way president bush is handling that state's power woes, according to a new poll. ?but the survey shows more californians are placing blame for the problem on utility companies, former governor pete  wilson and current governor gray davis than on president bush and the federal government. ?the democrats are trying hard to convince californians that republicans should be held accountable for the power problem. ?here is a democratic congressional campaign committee ad that begins airing in los  angeles today. ??narrator: california's energy crisis is deepening, with summer blackouts predicted and rate hikes of up to 80 percent. yet president bush has offered  no relief to hard-pressed rate payers. ?his spokesman saying, ""the president continues to believe that the issue is mostly a california matter"" and our representative, stephen horn, has joined with bush in opposing a temporary cap on electricity prices. ?call congressman horn and tell him we need action now. ??woodruff: the democratic committee said that it has bought significant air time for that spot, part of a month-long radio and tv ad campaign targeting republicans on energy. ?let's talk more now about energy politics with the director of that public policy institute of california poll we just told you about, mark baldassare joins us now from san francisco. ??mark, first of all, this poll finds californians pessimistic in general, did that surprise you? ??mark baldassare, california pollster: it did. ?for the past three years, we've been in an incredible time of optimism in california. ?two-thirds of californians have said that the state is going in the right direction. ?most californians felt that economic times would continue to be good, and most californians also were highly approving of the governor and the legislature. for the first time, we've seen a dramatic drop in optimism about the state, about the economy and ratings of the governor. ??baldassare: well, eight in ten californians say they have been closely following the electricity situation in the state and most californians are telling us in our survey that they consider it the top issue and 80 percent of californians say it's a big problem and moreover, a problem that is going to effect the economy. ?so there's been a great deal of uncertainty that's been created by the electricity situation and because of that uncertainty, people  are beginning to feel very nervous about our state. ??woodruff: so you're saying because of the electricity crisis, if you want to call it that in california, it's now driving people's views of everything: population, the economy, across-the-board. improving the schools, for instance. ?now only 6 percent in our most recent survey said that's the issue that concerns them most in the state. ?and we see that there is growing pessimism at the same time that there is growing concern that this electricity situation is not under control and could affect the state's economy. schneider reported earlier on the program that americans, overall, are having mixed views about to what extent president bush is responsible. ?here we're learning in california, they hold president bush far less responsible than  they do local leaders. ??baldassare: yeah, well, we are at time right now in california where people haven't experienced the rate hikes yet. ?they've certainly heard about them. they haven't experienced, for the most part, frequent rolling blackouts, but they hear that they're coming. and so when we talk about blame, people are focused on what happened five years ago to put us into this situation. ?and  for that, of course, they don't blame either the current governor or the current president. ?now, as we go forward over the next few months, people are going  to be re-assigning blame as well as re-evaluating the solutions that are in  place, and that's why i think both the democrats and republicans are very urgently trying to get their message out right now about who they think is to blame and who they think has the best solutions. we just saw the democrats running out there, are those likely to have an  effect on people's views? a effect on people's views over these next few months is how the crisis is actually resolved. ?and if people feel that these electricity hikes have  really, you know, altered their lifestyle or they're going to impact the economy, if they feel blackouts are really going to, you know, put them in an  uncomfortable situation going through the summer, then my guess is they are going to give blame both to bush and to davis. ??woodruff: all right, mark baldassare of the california public policy institute. ?thanks very much, good to see you again. ??baldassare: thank you. ?same here. ??woodruff: as california tries to ease its energy problems, there are  concerns about the cost not only for consumers, but for the environment. ?cnn's rusty dornin takes a closer look at the issues being raised by one california  plant's effort to expand. ??rusty dornin, cnn correspondent (voice-over): an aging giant known as the mighty moss. ?the 50-year-old moss landing natural gas plant along  california's coast owned by duke energy. ?a face lift and an expansion will soon make this the largest power generator in the state, providing 2.3 million homes with light, heat and air conditioning. ?but all that power takes water to cool the turbines, water that's home to otters, fish, herons and other wildlife. ??carolyn nielsen, plant opponent: every day, duke will use 333 football-size incomprehensible. ??dornin: water from the wetlands run through the plant, returning to the  ocean 30 degrees warmer. ?been that way for 50 years. ?now environmentalists worry that increasing the intake will sterilize any creature sucked in. ??patricia matejcek, sierra club: everything that lives in that volume of water: eggs from fish from clams, diatoms, young fish, everything in it will  be killed. ??dornin: environmentalists say the mighty moss got a break on the approval process, as regulators here faced the state's energy crisis. it took 14  months. permitting for smaller plants in the state is down to 21 days. ??kaitilin gaffney, center for marine conservation: it's so fast that my concern is that we wouldn't even catch really obvious problems because we are just are not taking a hard look at these plants at all. environmental groups signed off on the mighty moss renovation plan. ??gaffney: so at the eleventh hour, we were able to work out this deal with duke to at least ensure that the scientific monitoring will go on. the wetlands and in donations to local environmental groups. there will also be an independent monitor who will assess any damage to the environment. ??tom williams, duke energy: this will more than compensate any potential effects that the new power plant will have on the habitat. this state is in an energy crisis. ?the new plant we're bringing on is cleaner, more efficient  than virtually any plant in the country today. ??dornin: environmentalists made a deal here, but many fear, in a power-hungry state, taking what they can get may be their only option. ??rusty dornin, cnn, moss landing, california. seen in a whole new light in some circles. ?former president ford is honored  for ??that's next on inside politics. ??woodruff: it is something that many americans that lived through the watergate era might never dream they would see. ?an award named for a  democratic icon presented to the man who angered many democrats by pardoning richard  nixon. ??cnn's bruce morton has an inside view of this twist on political history. ??caroline kennedy schlossberg, john kennedy's daughter: he placed his love of country ahead of his own political future. ?we are honored to present you, president ford, with the john f. kennedy profile in courage award for 2001. award because, as a new unelected president, he pardoned his predecessor, richard nixon, who had resigned in disgrace to avoid impeachment over the watergate scandal. ??richard m. nixon, 37th president of the united states: i shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow. watergate. but really, what would end it? ?nixon could still face charges. ??gerald ford, 38th president of the united states: my conscience tells me  that only i, as president, have the constitutional power to firmly shut and seal  this book. ??ford: a full, free and absolute pardon unto richard nixon. ??morton: many americans thought that was a mistake. against his actions then, but time has a way of clarifying past events. ?and now we  see that president ford was right. ??morton: not everyone agrees. ?ford's press secretary at the time, gerald ter horst, resigned to protest the nixon pardon and still thinks it was wrong. ??jerry ter horst, former ford press secretary: he was going to go off house, from the chief of staff on down to ehrlichman, chuck colson and others  they were going to have to do prison time; they were not going to get pardons. many things could have swung it, but the pardon was surely one. ?jimmy carter, who beat ford, thanked him inauguration day. ??james earl carter, 39th president of the united states: for myself and for our nation, i want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our  land. ??morton: accepting the award, ford talked about the need for courage today in a politics dominated by ""partisan jockeying at the expense of public policy."" ??ford: i sense a longing for community, a desire on the part of americans to be part of something bigger, finer than themselves. ??morton: historians may still argue about the pardon. ?they agree he cared about his country and its politics, and did what he thought was right.

"you may have seen this when it first came out a while back ... but it's worth a rerun. california's dim bulbs regulation copyright (c) 2001 bell & howell information and learning company. all rights reserved. copyright cato institute spring 2001 the final word  california is in the midst of an enormous stupidity crisis. californians have been sitting in the dark because ... they didn't turn the lights on. they say they're short of electricity. yes, they are. between 1988 and 1998, california's electricity consumption increased by 15 percent. meanwhile california's capacity to generate electricity shrank by five percent, even as the state hesitated to build new power lines to tap into neighboring states' power supplies.  californians didn't want dams across their rivers, derricks on their ocean, power lines across their borders, or fossil fuel smoke in their sky. these might interfere with all the smart things californians do, such as hang-glide. california was going to rely on ""negawatts"" - dramatic power conservation. (but california regulators put price controls on electricity that lowered prices, and even californians weren't dumb enough to skip a bargain.) and california was going to rely on alternative power generation. with all the puffery from silicon valley dot.com start-ups, wind farms wouldn't be a problem. and doesn't gwyneth paltrow's star shine bright enough to operate a solar panel? but it turns out that alternative power generation is an alternative, mostly, to generating power.  californians are people who insist on growing their own vegetables, but they won't dig up the pretty lawn, won't plant anything for fear of getting dirty, and they use fragrant bath salts from the body shop instead of smelly compost. let them make their crudites with crab grass. president bush was wrong to grant an extension of executive orders requiring out-of-state utilities to supply power to california. and everyone is wrong to listen to californians whine about electricity deregulation.  there never was any deregulation. the california public utilities commission merely changed its regulations, which apparently weren't stupid enough to meet golden state standards. under california's 1996 re-regulation plan, electric companies sold their generating plants and became distributors. they were required to buy their power on the wholesale spot market and forbidden to enter into any long-term power supply contracts. retail electricity prices were lowered by 10 percent and frozen at the new rate until march 2002.  this is like requiring a&p to sell you porterhouse at $2 a pound, no matter what the price of beef on the hoof. imagine how many steaks there would be, and how many supermarkets. go to one of those boarded-up grocery stores, purchase a phantom t-bone, screw it into a ceiling fixture, and try to light your house. you're in california.  californians devised a system of electricity sales that ignored every dimension of the free market. (interesting that the ""information economy"" is centered in a place that's immune to information.) the free market is a yardstick, and californians got smacked with it. mideast oil jitters, cold weather, natural gas price spikes, and the plain unpredictable freedom of the free market caused wholesale electricity costs to rise and california utilities to go $12 billion into the red.  california's governor gray davis responded with the full force of bikini beach brain. in a january 8 speech to the state legislature, davis proposed creating a state agency to buy generating plants and build new ones. he threatened to expropriate power generators and transmission grids. he called for laws to allow criminal prosecution of wholesale suppliers who withheld electricity from california markets. and he said the state's universities and community colleges would build co-generating plants and become energy independent. (with gas produced by the cafeteria food?) gray davis sounded like joseph stalin with the iq of keanu reeves. ""everyone should understand that there are other, more drastic measures that i am prepared to take if i have to,"" davis declaimed.  ""take"" is the key word. grabby californians tried to regulate themselves into some cheap electricity. hoggish california power companies went along because the stateimposed retail price ceiling was also a retail price floor. according to the los angeles times, during the first 28 months of the scheme, pacific gas and electric and california edison made $20 billion from the legally required mark-up between wholesale and retail electric prices.  californians want to snatch that money back. ""consumer advocates around california... said it did not matter that the utilities were returning investments to their shareholders,"" reported the january 31 washington post. ""they took the money and ran,"" said state senator john burton. as opposed to californians, who took the electricity and roller-bladed? now the juice and the jack are both gone, and the california legislature has had to pass a bill authorizing $10 billion to try to clean up the mess.  but the californians could still pull a scam. the bill mandates long-term power contracts at rates that are way above what future prices should be. the hope, one guesses, is that congress, or the president, or somebody will let the state skip out on those contracts once the costs are lower.  it would be wrong to call californians stupid. they're sleazy, too.  r j. o'rourke is the cato institute's h. l. mencken research fellow and is foreign affairs desk chief for rolling stone. he is author of several bestselling books, including parliament of whores, give war a chance, age and guile, and eat the rich.",0

"this note is to report on two electricity legislative developments: the aug. 2nd introduction of an anti-rto bill (or at least anti-mandatory rtos) and on a meeting i had yesterday afternoon with andy black, the policy coordinator for chairman joe barton on the house energy and air quality subcommittee, to discuss their intentions with respect to electricity legislation this fall. on aug. 2nd (the last day congress was in session before the august recess), the above named members of the house energy and air quality subcommittee introduced h.r. 2814, the interstate transmission act.  the legislation is bad because, among other things, it requires ferc to establish transmission pricing policies that provide incentives for voluntary participation and formation of rtos, with language prohibiting policies that have the effect of forcing transmitting utilities to join rtos.  also objectionable is that the bill would ""limit"" pancaking but at the same time require ferc to establish a ""reasonable transition mechanism or period"" for additive charges.  the legislation prohibits ferc from conditioning any order upon a transmitting utility being required to transfer operational control of jurisdictional facilities to an iso or rto.  the bill would require that participating transmitting utilities must approve the form, structure and operating entity of any rto. in addition to the rto language, the bill has the ""old"" version of the nerc reliability legislation in it.  the bill also has a puhca exemption for rtos, repeals federal power act sec. 203 on the disposition of property and includes the tax changes that ious seek for transfers of property to an independent transmission company. 2.  andy black meeting chairman barton supports rtos.  at a minimum, the draft will affirm ferc's authority as the commissioners have requested.  andy is considering going beyond that to mandate rto participation.  not sure he can hold that position in the subcommittee.  he is looking to enron and others to help them explain and build support for rtos.  informed him of our initial informal coalition steps.  however, andy asked me to look at sec. 3 of the sawyer-burr referenced above, which i realized after the meeting is the part that deals with incentive rates and negotiated rates to expand transmission and voluntary rtos.  i have a call in to andy to reconcile these statements since the sawyer-burr bill is based on voluntary rtos.  hopefully, he is thinking of using the incentive and negotiated rate language and not the objectionable voluntary rto aspects.  i will strongly encourage him to ""do the right thing"" in that regard. c.  purpa prospective repeal.  on back up power, they are thinking of requiring that rates for back up power be just and reasonable until there is retail competition in the state. d.   interconnection they have received a proposal from trigen that andy says we will like.  i am contacting epsa to get the details. f.   transmission jurisdiction on siting, andy is thinking of some type of mechanism that would give a state one year before federal eminent domain attaches. h.   reliability on a negative note, andy intends to use the latest nerc reliability language because nerc's version has strong support among the members of the subcommittee and no other alternative has emerged with political support (i.e., not pjm).  i explained our concerns.  he said our best bet is for doe or ferc to come forward to seek something other than the nerc version.  he said members eyes glaze over on reliability with everything else on the plate. i.   negawatts i raised the absence of negawatts on his issue list.  he said he is open to considering it again, but that there was left over political baggage and unresolved issues from when this was attempted during consideration of the ""california bill"" earlier this summer. your questions and comments on the any of the above are most welcome.",0

(ene) has been quietly striking up deals with some suburban communities to sell them fixed-price power at a lower rate.   in the past month, the houston-based electricity service provider entered into long-term fixed-rate contracts with the city of roseville and is negotiating similar deals with the cities of san marcos and chula vista. both of those cities currently get their power from san diego gas & electric co, a unit of sempra energy inc. (sre), and pay market rates for electricity.   enron has also struck a deal with starwood hotels & resorts worldwide inc. (hot), one of the world's largest hospitality companies, to sell the company electricity at a fixed rate for the next 10 years. the company has four hotels in california, three of which buy their power from sdg&e.   sources close to the matter said enron has contracted to sell the hotel power at about 6 cents per kilowatt-hour, compared with the 22.5 cents/kwh starwood said it was charged by sdg&e in august.   neither company would disclose the terms of the deal. but starwood said it years.   enron, the largest trader of electricity and natural gas in the u.s., will purchase power to cover such contracts on the wholesale markets and use its experience to manage the risks, while paying a fee to utilities like sdg&e for use of their distribution networks.   ""that really is our core strength,"" said harold buchanan, chief operating officer for enron energy services north america. ""we understand how to manage those risks.""   high rates driving industrial customers, cities to switch   the growing interest in fixed-price supply contracts is fueling a comeback of sorts for enron.   the houston-based company had tried to break into california's retail power market just after deregulation, even spending nearly $1 million to advertise the venture during the super bowl. but enron gave up trying to win residential customers in 1998, citing disappointing response and lower-than-expected profits.   that was when deregulation and competitive power markets were full of promise. oddly enough, now that deregulation is coming under attack in california, soaring power prices are building demand for enron's services.   the company is fielding calls from large industrial customers in san diego that have seen their utility bills triple in the past three months and are interested in signing long-term fixed-rate contracts, buchanan said.   ""overall, what enron can provide is reliability pricing in san diego that's written in stone,"" buchanan said. ""it's far cheaper than what they're paying now with the utilities.""   a number of large industrial customers negotiating with enron declined to comment.   the city of roseville, near sacramento, entered into a $114 million contract with enron last month to purchase 50 megawatts of electricity for five years   furthermore, the city has started talks with enron about building and operating a 750-megawatt natural gas-fired power plant that city officials expect will contribute to lower costs for the purchase of electricity.   mayor harry crabb said the plant could protect residents from the price spikes that have plagued customers of sdg&e since june.   san marcos, in san diego county, is proposing to switch electricity service it would offer the city terms nearly identical to those it offered roseville.   an sdg&e spokesman said last week that the utility supports such arrangements, saying they're one way deregulation is supposed to work.   enron offered earlier this summer to sell power to sdg&e itself for four high.   california gov. gray davis signed legislation two weeks ago to cap electricity rates for sdg&e's customers at 6.5 cents/kwh. folder name: enron energy services to review or revise your folder, visit http://www.djinteractive.com or  contact dow jones customer service by e-mail at   or contact your local sales representative.)",0

"sorry about this gang, but my new computer messed up the e-mail list. getting this for the second time this morning. gba organization: foothill services content-type: multipart/alternative;  the friday burrito ""...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate."" everyone is getting into the act.  when i started this gig, i was the only guy in town writing to folks like you about the power industry in california.  i wrote about what?s new, what?s happening, and all the important stuff.  this week, governor gray davis decided to write his own burrito.  his epistle got more press than mine, but why is he muscling in on my turf?  not to be outdone, puc president loretta lynch released a report which looks into every facet of california?s power business.  no stone left unturned. i?m telling you, there isn?t enough room in this business for all of us.  they need to clear out. with people like herr (hair?) peace, governor i?m-not mr.-rogers davis and let?s do lynch, who needs a friday burrito?  they re-define our reality each week with mind-numbing aplomb.  for example, starting in early june, the px was ordered to compete for business against other qualified trading vehicles.  then, two weeks later, the energy f_hrer legislated that idea to an early death which kept the status quo for at least one year.  this week the puc approved 5-year bilateral deals for pg&e and sce, thereby opening the px to competition, and emasculating the px?s block forward market. zip, bam, boom. i can?t wait to see what next week will bring.  i hear senator bowen is holding committee hearings on re regulating the industry, and the governor?s new energy security council will meet to decide six things: does anyone have good seats for next week?s democratic convention? is there anyone we haven?t indicted yet in the power industry? who will crank up the air conditioning in this room?  it?s getting too warm. then, they will collect data from innocent businesses under subpoena, ignore the facts, and publish a report.  it makes one want to take a deep breath, and inhale the scented fumes of democracy. you know, i can?t think about where to begin, so let?s start somewhere. well, the answer very clearly is no.  i have been astounded by repeated attempts of sdg&e?s most senior people to ape humans, but instead they mimic apes. consider the following.  first, they waltz their default customers into the summer with little of no protection from price spikes in the wholesale market.  forgivable in that it is human to err.  the prices skyrocket in june, and they start looking for who to blame.  _must be them damn independent generators,o say their managers.  gary cotton informs the iso governing board that hedging sdg&e?s position in the block forward market wouldn?t have made any difference.  there?s one nobel laureate who missed his prime. next, under pressure, they ask for help from suppliers and anyone else who will assist the utility and their customers.  nine offers show up at their table, and they can?t choose any of them.  again, mr cotton tells his fellow iso governing board members that these things take time, and we don?t to rush since there are many legislative barriers, and, well, the surfing was good this week so why spoil it? now they are in a panic because the energy f_hrer is visiting old ladies living in trailer parks, advising them not to pay their sdg&e electricity bill, and to continue to operate their air conditioners. sdg&e puts a full page ad in the local newspaper telling everyone that sdg&e is doing everything it can to lower their electric bills, by calling the iso [address and phone number provided in the ad] and urging them to lower the cap.  i always thought the location of the iso was a state secret for security reasons.  no secrets in san diego. but we are not done.  no sir, we are not.  those buffalo heads who run that company decide they will win a gold star on their collective foreheads, and implement one of the four resolutions passed by the electric oversight board.  the one they pick is to petition ferc on an energy or ancillary services into the iso and the px.  the primary reason is that western power markets are not workably competitive.  in other words, they want ferc to set a max price on what generators can sell in addition to the price limit at which the iso can buy! what i find most astounding about this double talk is that sdg&e continues to collect tons of money from the sales of regulatory must run energy into the px.   these are sales from their stranded assets.  their grief hasn?t abated their greed. so, to recap, sdg&e missed the boat on price hedging, failed to win consumer confidence in public meetings, asked for help from suppliers and did nothing in response, then filed at ferc to cap the sale price because the wholesale market into which they sell (over-priced?) energy is not workably competitive.  too much time in the direct sun light. the puc report released yesterday is a gem with which i have not spent enough time.  i only read the executive summary, and that only because our counsel, dan douglass forwarded me a copy. let me pick out some of the gems in president lets do lynch?s burrito.  i would recommend reading the whole text if you have time, and if you seek perverse entertainment. _california is experiencing major problems with electricity supply and pricing caused by policies and procedures adopted over the past ten years. _ since june, wholesale prices for electrical power in california have over $1 billion in excess   payments for electricity. _hot weather, aging power plant and transmission infrastructure, and dysfunctional bidding behavior in the wholesale power markets combined to drive prices up ... _because of serious market defects and tight supply of electricity, purchasers of california power will likely pay billions more in electricity costs this year. moreover, these price increases do not necessarily fund new investments in electricity supply or delivery reliability - they may flow solely to power producer profit margins. _despite the electricity oversight board's legislative mandate to oversee those institutions, we have been unable to obtain [bid] data. nevertheless, ... , we believe enough evidence of questionable behavior exists that the attorney general should conduct an investigation into these statewide market practices, coordinating with other state agencies, including the puc and the eob. such an investigation would provide the factual foundation that california policy makers and regulators need to recover any illegally obtained profits. _a momentous consequence of california's attempt to create a market in electricity is that the federal government now regulates california's electric system. washington d.c. now controls pricing decisions directly at the wholesale level and indirectly at the retail level and, to the extent that supply incentives are correlated to prices, washington, d.c. now affects california's ability to attract new investment in power plants. _past administrations' willingness to cede the state's authority to the federal government combined with the legislative creation of two non-public supervisory organizations that have no duty to protect the public or consider the retail customer. the ""independent system corporations that operate the state's transmission system and control wholesale pricing policies, are governed by boards whose members can have serious conflicts of interest. some of these board members or their companies financially benefit from higher prices in electricity markets. neither of these private organizations is accountable to the state or its consumers .... _despite the federalization and the fragmentation of the state's electric services, the state of california should protect its businesses and consumers from cartel pricing; collusive behavior; inadequate power plant maintenance and lack of market planning for adequate electricity supplies. _california consumers and businesses deserve to know in advance - as san diegans did not this summer - how and when the price of an essential service like electricity will double. california is now largely constrained by federal mandates from providing comprehensive retail price relief as long as wholesale prices remain so high. if california tried to re-impose a price freeze in san diego now, federal regulators would likely prevent that action.  ... short-term price relief, however, cannot resolve market gaming or fundamental wholesale pricing problems controlled by federal regulators.  _we have been precluded from obtaining the data necessary to know if the iso and px failed to detect manipulation and gaming on several fronts. we do not know how market players acted in price offering and bidding and scheduling. the ferc has just announced an inquiry into national pricing and energy market issues. california should not wait for national findings before it investigates california market practices. we recommend that the california attorney general immediately subpoena relevant records and data to determine the pricing and offering behavior of market participants; the actions of the iso and its board members; and the actions of generators in supplying california's energy needs. _ten actions to consider or act upon to prevent current electricity      2. create a california energy council, modeled on the national      security council, to unify state action to resolve energy      problems and to perform integrated energy planning;      moderate california wholesale market pricing;      western regional markets and find that no competitive market ...      data and enhance the state's enforcement capability for power      plant maintenance; price manipulation and generation gaming,      consistent with protection of proprietary business      additional oversight authority for the iso and px. _ten issues to consider or act upon within the next six months: ...      4. streamline state power plant siting procedures; consistent      with environmental requirements, and prioritize applications      licensing and emissions credits rules to ensure power plants      wholesale and retail prices and reduce excess profitso i told you i don?t need to write a burrito anymore.  the democrats in sacramento are doing that for me.  welcome comrade. it is really hard to describe the drama of an iso governing board meeting, especially when our favorite topic arises.  it seems the only time the board becomes animated is when one of three issues are on the agenda: price caps, ftrs, and priorities for software enhancements. otherwise, its pretty much hum-drum. %round and %round we went, once again.  a few more forced votes tipped the scale in favor of the cap.  there were 15 yes votes, which included a forced yes vote from our friend jerry toenyes by order of secretary of energy mr. richardson. [jerry, did you realize that the last letters of one of the brave and bold for standing up to that sort of intimidation for so long.  your picture in the sf chron said it all. the brave souls who stood tall and voted no included david parquet (enron), jan smutny-jones (iep), barbara barkovich (cleca), caolyn now, i must admit that dynegy?s greg blue did help by voting a texas no, in houston to work with greg to correct that problem.  we?re going to work things out. the energy f_hrer addressed the board, again.  i didn?t mind that i only had a few brief, very brief moments to address the board, and herr at everyone who opposed him.  he pined about camden quitting the board. he said he knew how prices and markets work, that it isn?t the way those academic egg-head, ferc-loving economists tell you who pray to the gods of competition.  he lambasted wapa for withholding generation to protect fish and wildlife (what was that all about?).  he predicted that on thursday?s puc meeting he and all the other powerful democrats, republicans and angry citizens of san diego would demand that the puc impose a rate cap on retail electric rates in san diego that are just very delusional. he believes that steve, and only steve peace can save the world.  he believes that political will trumps judicial, quasi-judicial, or independent board actions.  this man makes relevant all the abstract musings of the philosopher friedrich nietzsche values, etc. but we are getting under (uber?) his skin, with the help of the press. wednesday afternoon i called commissioner dick bilas to see if he thought whether the next day?s puc meeting was going to be a roll over. dick said he got a call from peace, and that peace said he would not come to the meeting.  apparently, peace had received a lot of press, and all of it bad. that?s the thin line of freedom which keeps tyranny at least one step away from our front door. and now, the good news.  you deserve this.  ferc gave the california market a little wiggle room last friday.  ferc issued a last minute reply to the complaint by morgan stanley capital group relating to the iso?s intent to lower the price cap.  ferc denied the complaint, but they didn?t waste time with an order to simply deny a complaint.  ferc danced on the head of the iso and pulled the bite out of the price cap. here are some excerpts: prices but because it would promote order and transparency in the market by clearly telling sellers of the maximum price the iso was willing to pay and allowing sellers to make informed economic choices on whether to sell in the iso market or to sell elsewhere... _ ... the iso has no more or less ability to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these services ... if the iso is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase price ceiling (because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they choose), it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to meet its needs. ... therefore, an increase in out-of-market (oom) calls for generation may be necessary to maintain system reliability.  because the resulting overall payments may be higher. _to the extent the ... iso board resolution contemplates implementing a directive that generators must bid their capacity into the iso markets a requirement is not permitted by our ... order and the iso tariff. ... future implementation of the iso board resolution with regard to a requirement to sell would require significant revisions to the iso market rules.  such market changes could not become effective absent a corresponding amendment to the iso tariff which would have to be filed well. what do you think about that? just wait.  here is what the sleeping bear, commissioner hebert said in his concurring remarks: _getting to the bottom of the problem, in my view, requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our approval of the iso as the operator of the california grid.  the record supports such a move. ... a memorandum to the iso from a stakeholder who resigned from the governing board eloquently brings to our attention repeated attempts to undermine the independence of the iso. the memorandum also thoughtfully outlines consequences to the markets of a return to %command and control.? _because these allegations come from a non-market participant, especially should we take heed.  we must also take notice of the public pressure on the board to compromise its independence.o amen, brother, amen. as you can imagine, this week, like an endless string of weeks before this has been interminable.  i get about three phone calls a day from press reporters, very little of which ever sees print.  my shtick is just too complex for casual readers.  but i do notice that the reporters are asking better questions.  the public is becoming more savvy.  the information flow is moving in our favor, and will disarm the forces of i have other problems on my mind.  i am working on a new computer system.  really, it?s just an upgrade of an older computer that is a bit faster than the laptop i tried to upgrade, very unsuccessfully.  as a result of the all the new hardware and software i purchased, my office looks like a war zone with an odd mix of puc service copies, computer documentation, and diskettes laying all around. quite a mess. prepare for the future.  our next general meeting is scheduled for thursday and friday, october 5 and 6 at moro bay.  barb ennis will prepare a blurb for us in next week?s burrito about room reservations, timing, golf, etc.  our guest speakers will include msc chairman irene moosen of grueneich resource advocates who will make a presentation on the distributed generation case before the puc, and william freddo of pg&e national energy group who will give us some education on operating a power plant inside the new england iso. now for your daily bread, provided this week by dan douglass.  last week we had a joke about catholics.  this week it?s agnostics. an atheist was taking a walk thru the woods, admiring all that the accident  of evolution had created.  ""what majestic trees!  what powerful rivers! what  beautiful animals!""  he said to himself. as he was walking alongside the river he heard a rustling in the bushes charging  towards him. he ran as fast as he could up the path.  he looked over his  shoulder and saw that the bear was closing in on him. he tried to run even  faster, so scared that tears were coming to his eyes. his heart was pumping  frantically as he tried to run even faster, but he tripped and fell on the  ground.  he rolled over to pick himself froze.  the forest was silent.  the river even stopped flowing.  a bright light shone  upon the man, and a voice out of the sky said, ""you deny my existence all  these years, teach others i don't exist and even credit my creation to a  cosmic accident, and now do you expect me to the atheist, ever so proud, looked into the light and said, ""it would be rather hypocritical to ask to be counted as a believer after all these years,  but could you make the bear a believer?""

""things are going very well,"" said steve maviglio, a spokesman for gov. gray  davis.  to financially renovate the north-state utility, according to sources  familiar with the negotiations.  but consumer advocates insisted that even the $7 billion price is too much to  pay. and experts warned that a deal with pg&e will be more complex than with  other utilities.  pg&e representatives declined comment, in keeping with their policy on the  talks, even though the davis administration said an announcement could come  as early as next week or the following week. the new timetable for an  announcement was substantially sooner than in davis' original forecast.  until late last week, pg&e was still resisting the sale of its power grid  despite the fact that davis had announced the framework of an agreement with  southern california edison. davis expects to soon announce a similar deal  with the san diego gas and electric co. however, any such deal still would  need federal approval.  the investor-owned utilities, trapped between high wholesale costs and lower,  regulated retail rates, amassed nearly $13 billion in debts and were unable  to buy electricity this winter. with the onset of rolling blackouts, the  state began brokering billions of dollars in emergency short- and long-term  power purchases.  davis' strategy to ease the energy price and supply crisis includes  bolstering both conservation and generation while fiscally refurbishing the  nearly bankrupt utilities.  as part of the rescue deal, the utilities would have to drop legal actions  seeking dramatically higher electricity bills, environmentally shield  wildlands they own, sell power from their generators to californians for the  next decade and secure help with their debts from their parent companies.  power grids, the utilities would be allowed to sell bonds to raise funds and  use customer money to pay them off.  the state would upgrade the high-voltage lines and lease them back to the  utilities for operation. in a reflection of the negotiations with the three  utilities, a davis administration official said the deal with pg&e is proving  to be more complex than with the other firms.  though pg&e finally agreed late last week to sell its transmission grid, the  utility apparently wants more than the $7 billion that davis has offered,  according to sources.  the figure is more than twice the book amount, or the value placed on the  system for purposes of accounting. and that's the markup that lured edison  into an agreement to sell its smaller portion of the transmission grid for  but pg&e, which fears an erosion of its economic base, may be asking as much  industry, pg&e is more likely to lose revenue than edison as a result of  selling its transmission lines, according to experts.  big customers might be able to bypass the utility's remaining local  distribution lines, thereby eroding its customer base.  therefore the utility may view bankruptcy, and sale of its transmission lines  to the highest bidder, as a potentially attractive alternative to selling its  share of the grid to the state at too low a price. el paso energy closes six valley power plants by chip power, californian staff writer e-mail:   el paso energy, citing non-payment from pacific gas & electric co., said it  has shut down six cogeneration plants this week.  the smaller plants produced about 175 megawatts of electricity and are  located primarily in the san joaquin valley, said company spokesman mel  non-payment, according to the state independent system operator, which  manages most of the state's electrical distribution.  the el paso energy plants are operated with various partners and had not been  compensated for december, january and february deliveries, said scott. he  said he did not know the total amount due but said the plants would be closed  until pg&e's credit worthiness is improved.  a cogeneration plant, common in oil fields, simultaneously produces heat  energy and electrical or mechanical power from the same fuel in the same  facility. typically, it produces electricity and steam, which can be deployed  to enhance oil

state department of water resources for the customers of two  nearly bankrupt utilities.  pacific gas and electric co., southern california edison and the state  disagree over how the dwr eventually will be reimbursed for its purchases on  the expensive last-minute power market. so do the state power regulators, who  have the final call over who gets the money when.  under a recent law, the dwr went into the electricity-buying business to help  keep the two utilities from sinking further into their $13 billion debt. the  state plans to retrieve the money by selling $10 billion in revenue bonds.  the utilities continue to collect ratepayer dollars on that electricity,  which the bill's author, assemblyman fred keeley, d-boulder creek, says is  meant to help them begin paying down their debt.  in a recent letter, however, dwr officials requested that the state public  utilities commission order that a portion of that money be diverted to the  state.  but after the utilities subtract the costs of generating electricity,  payments to environmentally friendly power plants and other expenses, there  is no money left from ratepayer dollars to give to the dwr without sinking  further into debt, pg&e spokesman ron low said tuesday.  if it passed along money to the dwr, ""our undercollection would grow by about  the commission, unable to agree on the best course of action, left the issue  untouched at its last meeting but expects to revisit the issue when it meets  this morning. commissioner richard bilas is proposing an alternate plan that  would have the dwr set its own revenue requirements that would be passed on  to ratepayers.  the puc also is expected to respond to complaints from laid-off workers and  customers that layoffs by utilities to cut costs have been hurting service.  commissioner carl wood warned at the last meeting that failure to provide  safe and reliable service could mean fines for the utilities.  representatives from electrical workers unions, the puc and the utilities  were to discuss the issue tuesday afternoon.  ""i don't think we believe that utilities can find a way out of their problems  by laying off workers,"" said mindy spatt, a spokeswoman with the utility  reform network. ""we think consumers deserve safe and reliable service, and we  think they deserve it at a reasonable price."" state taxpayers in dark on details of energy deal  david lazarus, chronicle staff writer few people would purchase a car simply because the dealer said, ''trust me,  it's a great deal.'' yet gov. gray davis essentially is telling californians  just that about dozens of long-term power contracts.  because of confidentiality agreements with power companies, the governor has  revealed only scant details about the state's multibillion-dollar contracts  for electricity over the next 10 years.  heller, a spokesman for the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights in  neither davis nor power companies would divulge specific details about the  price, duration or scope of individual contracts. each cited secrecy clauses  that the governor's office said had been desired by both sides.  what consumers do know is this:  decade.  market went haywire last summer.  state nevertheless will be locked into paying above-market rates for  electricity.  but it is not known which generator agreed to part with the most power at the  cheapest level or the full range of the prices in concocting the $69 average.  moreover, it is unclear how shrewdly the state negotiated with taxpayer money  in securing power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities.  ""these agreements are the bedrock of our long-term energy policy,"" davis said  monday in announcing the deals.  the governor's office defended the murky nature of the contracts yesterday.  ""it's a business transaction in which private corporate information is  included,"" said steve maviglio, a spokesman for davis. ""that's the kind of  information that never gets revealed.""  while additional elements of the contracts will be publicized in coming  months, he said, the contracts themselves will remain a secret.  ""you'll never see all the details,"" maviglio said.  this did not sit well with many observers.  ""it's a breach of public trust,"" said daniel bacon, a san francisco attorney  specializing in business law. ""a public servant spending public money  shouldn't be able to keep the spending secret.""  but gary ackerman, executive director of the western power trading forum, an  energy-industry association in menlo park, called confidentiality agreements  ""a necessary evil in transactions like this.""  he explained that no power company would agree to a long-term contract if  rival firms could learn the terms of the accord. the company would be losing  too much of its competitive edge in the marketplace, ackerman said.  sellers.  a high price with one generator would not necessarily be sought by all power  providers.  still, the fact that public funds are being used makes confidentiality in  this case a different matter than, say, cisco systems' quietly negotiating to  take over yet another tech rival.  ""the public is in a very awkward position,"" said michael shames, executive  director of the utility consumers' action network in san diego. ""it has to  rely on the good word and expertise of the governor, and he has yet to  demonstrate that he has expertise or good word in this field.""  shames likened consumers to passengers in a plane being flown by a pilot  without a license to fly.  available right now.""  there's the rub. no matter how bad a deal california may have cut to help  on the other hand, it already appears that the new contracts will not shield  californians from the threat of daily outages this summer, when demand  surges. davis said only about 60 percent of the state's summertime  electricity needs so far had been met.  part of the reason is that many power companies already have contracted for  their output this year.  duke energy said this was why it would not begin its nine-year contract with  california until 2002, while williams cos. said it would only gradually  increase the amount of available wattage in its 10-year contract.  both companies, meanwhile, will continue to profit this summer by selling  into the volatile ""spot"" market, where wholesale power went for as much as  ""you can't sell all your power into long-term contracts,"" said paula hall-  collins, a williams spokeswoman. ""you save some for the spot market.""  consumer groups worry that consumers will be hammered again this summer with  sky-high power prices, and then get nailed down the road by contracts for  above-market rates.  being gouged for 10 years,"" said heller of the foundation for taxpayer and  consumer rights. ""but the governor doesn't want us to see that.""  ackerman of the western power trading forum said the state had gotten the  best rates it could under current market conditions.  ""california went for long-term contracts when everyone else moved in as  well,"" he said. ""californians are paying a price for not acting sooner."" lawmakers pitch fixes for region's energy woes  by david whitney bee washington bureau wholesale price caps to extending daylight-saving time an extra hour to help  the region cope this summer with its persistent electricity shortage, but  none of the ideas seemed to catch fire at a house hearing tuesday.  ""people will die in california because of this crisis,"" rep. brad sherman, a  los angeles-area republican, warned the house energy and commerce committee.  sherman testified that his idea for saving lives is to extend daylight-saving  time by an extra hour, so that there would be more daylight at the end of the  day when power consumption surges.  ""one of the peak demand periods for electricity occurs between 5 p.m. and 8  p.m., when the sun sets and people come home from work,"" sherman testified.  ""if people come home and it is light out, there is less of an inclination to  sherman said the state legislature has called for congressional approval for  states to be given authority to extend daylight-saving time, and he cited  analyses by the california energy commission and other agencies suggesting  that it could cut power consumption by 1 percent to 2 percent.  sherman, who was one of about a dozen california lawmakers presenting their  views on the energy squeeze, drew no questions from committee leaders about  what his legislation might do to everything from airline schedules to  television programming if west coast states didn't agree on the same time  standard.  most of the committee's questioning was on the more popular idea proposed by  several california and western lawmakers, primarily democrats, to require the  federal energy regulatory commission to impose caps on wholesale electricity  prices that have gone wild because of a regional power shortage.  rep. bob filner, d-san diego, charged that the price spiral has little to do  with power shortages but a lot to do with a ""small cartel"" of generators  bilking ratepayers.  rep. jay inslee, d-wash., said he brought up the idea of regional price caps  with president bush, who was initially skeptical. but inslee said that bush  warmed to the idea after being told that protections could be built into the  caps so as not to discourage construction of new power plants.  upon hearing that, inslee said, bush invited him to meet with the president's  cabinet-level task force led by vice president dick cheney on a national  energy strategy. but inslee said he can't get the group to meet with him.  ""it's very disappointing,"" inslee said.  tuesday's hearing was part of a series the panel is holding on the california  crisis, so far without any emerging consensus on what, if anything, congress  should do. power plan called wrong  wall street analysts say the governor's approach to the problem avoids the  issue that caused the imbalance.  by don thompson the associated press  sacramento california's scramble to insulate consumers from the soaring price  of electricity may add to the state's power problems this summer, wall street  analysts said tuesday.  gov. gray davis' emphasis on buying utilities' transmission lines and  negotiating long-term power contracts to help ease their debts skirts the  deep imbalance between wholesale and market rates that led to the state's  power problems in the first place, they said.  ""in the long run, it doesn't solve anything,"" said michael worms, an industry  analyst for gerard klauer mattison & co. ""in the long run, you need to send  the right price signals to consumers, which will create its own conservation  signals. unfortunately, customers were shielded from that in california.""  davis said monday that the state's first contracts to buy electricity for two  financially struggling utilities will provide only about two-thirds of the  power needed on a typical summer day, forcing californians to cut power use  at least 10 percent to avoid blackouts.  since early january, the state has been buying one- third of the power  southern california edison and pacific gas and electric co. customers need.  the two utilities, denied credit by suppliers, say they have lost nearly $14  billion due to soaring wholesale electricity prices that the state's  industry-deregulation law says they cannot pass on to consumers.  the keepers of the state power grid had enough electricity tuesday to avoid  declaring an electricity alert, but have faced an almost-daily scramble for  weeks due to a tight supply and high wholesale prices.  several wholesale and retail rate proposals are circulating. among them:  free-market advocates such as worms want an immediate end to the  deregulation-imposed retail rate freeze on edison and pg&e that will expire  next year.  he says have been prof iteering from california's short energy supply. the  bush administration and federal energy regulatory commission are cool to that  idea.  rates in the state and required suppliers to justify any higher prices they  charge.  consumer groups such as the utility reform network, or turn, want regulated  rates for residential and small-business customers, but free-market rates for  large industrial customers, which sought deregulation in the first place.  turn also advocates a tiered rate structure, with higher rates for consumers  who use more than a reasonable amount of electricity each month.  assembly republicans say electricity and natural-gas prices will fall  naturally if the state increases supply, mainly by making it easier to build  plants and pipelines.  ""right now, you're sort of sitting partially with regulation and part with  the free market,"" said paul fremont, an analyst with jefferies & co. ""both  these systems work. it's sort of that in-between system that you have in  califor nia that doesn't appear to be working.""  the system discourages generators from building new power plants because they  aren't guaranteed a profit, and it doesn't do enough to discourage power use  by consumers because the price they pay doesn't reflect the true cost of  power, fremont said.  ""i don't think people here have much faith in the market, and why should  they?"" countered turn's mindy spatt. ""i think there are probably better ways  of encouraging consumers to conserve than by gouging them.""  davis insists the crisis can be resolved without raising rates for edison and  pg&e customers beyond ""the existing rate structure.""  in january, state regulators imposed temporary rate hikes of 7 to 15 percent  on edison and pg&e customers.  the legislature and davis extended the increases for up to a decade to help  pay back the estimated $10 billion in power buying the state expects to do  for edison and pg&e over the next several years, and finance its purchase of  the power lines owned by the two companies and san diego gas & electric.  rates were already scheduled to increase next year for edison and pg&e  that rate cut will likely expire as planned, davis spokesman steve maviglio  has said.  davis wants those rates to cover not only the traditional cost of generating,  transporting and distributing power, but the added cost of paying off the two  utilities' massive debt and buying their transmission lines, said assemblyman  fred keeley, d-boulder creek, the assembly's chief power negotiator.  yet davis has indirectly addressed the rate imbalance by signing legislation  that will let regulators raise consumer rates if necessary, keeley said.  the governor and lawmakers are in effect spreading out rate increases over a  decade by using long-term revenue bonds to buy power for the nearly bankrupt  utilities, said severin borenstein, director of the university of california  energy institute.  or it's going to come from ratepayers,"" bor enstein said. ""raising rates now  would get us a lot of conservation.""  davis also wants financial incentives for conservation and power-plant  construction in time to make a difference this summer.  ""our mouths were agape"" at the rapid timetable, keeley said.  legislators are rushing to pass those incentives by month's end, he said,  allowing three months for consumers and suppliers to act before the heat of  summer.  among bills considered tuesday, the senate energy committee approved  legislation to accelerate the siting of power plants. it also was considering  a proposal to restructure rates for generators that use renewable energy to  provide about 30 percent of the state's electricity. bill to cut some power prices stalls  energy: democrats balk at varying payment levels for alternative generators.  by dan morain, julie tamaki, times staff writers of the power consumed in california stalled tuesday, as democrats questioned  to receive higher payments than others.       lawmakers working to unravel california's energy mess have been  generators of alternative power by more than half, to below 8 cents a  kilowatt-hour.       those alternative generators' contracts with utilities have shot up in  recent months because of a rise in the price of natural gas. the  cash-strapped corporations have suspended or made partial payments to the  generators over the last few months, causing many to shut down or reduce  their outputs.       but even as the lawmakers reached agreement that pushed the average  price to near the 8-cent level per kilowatt-hour, some generators would have  received higher prices under the bill by state sen. jim battin (r-la quinta).       battin acknowledged that he has received campaign contributions from  some wind power generators but said there is no connection between the  donations and the bill's provisions. ""it is illegal, it is unethical and it's  alternative energy producers are in his district.       as democrats on the senate energy committee blocked the bill, battin  warned that some alternative energy producers might react to the delay by  trying to force southern california edison and pacific gas & electric into  bankruptcy.  committee chairwoman debra bowen (d-marina del rey) to retort: ""i'm really  tired of being threatened with bankruptcy.""       alternative energy producers, including those that use wind, solar  power, biomass and other means, produce 27% of the energy used in california.  they sell the electricity to the utilities, which in turn transmit it to  retail consumers. but with the utilities facing multibillion-dollar debts,  the alternative energy producers under contract with edison have not been  paid since november.       scores of alternative energy producers supported the measure. edison  international and the san francisco-based consumer group, the utility reform  network, opposed it. michael florio of the utility reform group said the deal  could result in higher consumer prices; an edison representative said the  same thing.  arrangement with many of the generators. keeley took the lead in the early  negotiations, and then turned to battin to introduce the legislation, sb 47x.       rather convoluted language would have allowed higher payments to a  select few generators that produce electricity from wind and biomass.       most of california's wind suppliers, for instance, would have received  about 6 cents per kilowatt-hour. but a handful of them, about half a dozen       battin contends that other wind producers receive additional payments  that boost them to the same level as windtec and others that would get the  higher payments.  would benefit from the provisions he added to the bill.       in california's overall energy market, the amount of money that would  have flowed to the favored generators is minor. but the added prices that  would have been paid to the generators would have translated to at least $19  million in the next five years, to be absorbed by southern california edison  customers, according to one analysis.       also tuesday, more details were disclosed about another leg of the  generators to supply electricity to california for as long as 10 years.  bedrock"" of california's energy policy. but some consumer advocates warned  that the deals could lock the state into excessively high-priced contracts.       s. david freeman, the general manager of the los angeles department of  water and power and davis' negotiator, said that the state guarded against  expected to be available this summer, about one-third of the energy needed by  the state, freeman said. the amount of power under contract swells until more  contracts, which may turn out to be somewhat higher or somewhat lower than  the spot market,"" and purchases on the spot market. pg&e could face mutiny on outages: smud, others may balk if utility orders  summer blackouts  by carrie peyton bee staff writer sacramento's electric utility wants out of a deal that imposes rolling  blackouts locally on pg&e's command.  so do a lot of other utilities.  they've been writing letters, lobbying lawmakers and launching informal talks  with pacific gas and electric co. to get off the hook before summer.  who dodges the blackout bullet ""is going to play out as a political hot  button"" around the state, said george fraser, head of the northern california  power agency, a coalition of municipal utilities.  in sacramento, the next volley is expected soon, with the sacramento  municipal utility district reportedly poised to notify pg&e that it will no  longer black out homes and businesses on the larger utility's command.  ""we are absolutely trying to fight off the requirement for rolling blackouts  for the sacramento area,"" said linda davis, one of seven elected members of  the smud board of directors.  saying they don't want to be dragged down by somebody else's problems, two  southern california utilities have written grid operators asking to be  exempted from any blackouts caused by pg&e's or southern california edison's  financial woes.  this together,"" said spokesman john nelson.  the maneuvering comes amid bleak forecasts for power supplies this summer.  although gov. gray davis has said conservation, new power plants and moderate  weather could avert blackouts, officials at the independent system operator,  which runs much of california's grid, expect frequent rotating outages.  one consulting firm, cambridge energy research associates, predicts 20 hours  of rolling blackouts during july and august, and about 200 hours of  especially intense calls for voluntary cutbacks.  before blackouts hit, the jockeying over just whose lights, air conditioners  and assembly lines will be shut down is growing. the outcome could affect  millions of people statewide.  the state public utilities commission is probing rolling blackout programs  run by the for-profit utilities it regulates, including pg&e and edison.  a puc analysis has suggested that pg&e's program, which currently exempts  about 40 percent of its customers, should spread the burden more broadly. for  example, it said, 1.9 million homes and businesses are spared just because  they share a circuit with a customer deemed ""essential.""  but not-for-profit utilities such as smud, which answer to their own elected  boards or city councils, have other worries.  many have already lined up their power supplies for summer. some have raised  rates or are considering raising rates. some have taken extra conservation  steps. they think those preparations ought to give them leverage to ease  blackout clauses in their contracts with pg&e.  smud general manager jan schori ""is going to use every avenue ... any avenue,  to put pressure on,"" including lobbying the iso, the governor and others,  said utility director davis.  the northern california power agency, a joint-powers authority that owns and  operates power plants for municipal utilities, has begun informal  negotiations with pg&e to change blackout rules, according to fraser, its top  executive.  it is preparing to write pg&e, asking that its members be exempted from  outages altogether. failing that, it wants them to face fewer outages or to  be compensated for cutting off power, he said.  at smud, the utility board has met in closed session to discuss exactly what  it is required to do during electric emergencies, under terms of the  interconnection contract that links smud's lines to pg&e's.  ""the contracts are being inspected with a fine-tooth comb,"" said smud  director howard posner.  schori declined to comment on any specifics. sources indicated that the main  option being considered is notifying pg&e that because of changed  circumstances, smud believes it no longer is required to routinely comply  with outage requests.  other options being explored include re-negotiating existing agreements with  posner said that ever since two days of rolling blackouts in january,  constituents have been asking him, "" 'why are we participating when we're not  electricity under contract to meet its customers' summer demands. they  believe pg&e should do the same.  ""we're almost like a david against goliath here,"" said board vice president  genevieve shiroma. ""the huge investor-owned utilities next door have severe  problems that they need to get under control.""  in addition, smud plans to argue that because it can cut usage through its  ""peak corps"" program, which remotely turns off air conditioners at volunteer  households, it has already done its part without rotating outages, director  davis said.  pg&e believes the interconnection agreements that govern smaller utilities'  ties to its transmission lines have ""benefits and burdens to both sides,""  said nelson.  ""it wouldn't be fair or good policy for just one provision to be altered  without taking a look at how that affects the entire contract,"" he said.  interconnection contracts generally have clauses that require utilities to  help each other out to avert greater emergencies.  stabilize the electric grid in the seconds after a major power plant or  transmission line fails.  ""it's been around in the electrical fabric forever,"" said jim pope, head of  silicon valley power, santa clara's city-run utility. in addition to legal  requirements, ""you have a moral obligation so you don't bring the system to  collapse.""  like other city-run utilities, silicon valley power has a contract with pg&e  that requires it to shed load during an electric emergency. but its contract  allows it to work with big users to reduce their demand, so no one has to be  completely shut off.  such agreements, formed long before deregulation when pg&e ran the north  independent system operator. the iso today runs pieces of the grid owned by  if it believes power use is about to surge past supply, potentially  triggering a grid collapse across the western united states, the iso notifies  the three utilities that they have to shed a certain number of megawatts.  the big utilities meet that requirement two ways. they cut circuits to some  of their own customers, and they tell smaller, connected utilities to cut a  proportionate share.  in northern california, about 80 percent of the outages are borne by pg&e  customers and the rest by customers of smud and other municipal utilities and  irrigation districts.  ""in one sense, we are all in this together. if smud were in danger of going  down, we would hope others would help us out,"" said smud's posner. ""but  that's if we're in danger from circumstances beyond our control, not from  mismanagement or lack of financial wherewithal.""  it is unclear what penalties, if any, a utility would face for violating an  interconnection agreement. in the long run, the issue would be fought either  in the courts or before the federal energy regulatory commission, grid  officials said.  as a practical matter, in the seconds when the risk to the grid is greatest,  if one utility refused to shed load, the iso would probably solve to problem  by calling on pg&e, edison or others who are willing to make deeper cutbacks,  they said. puc to decide fate of utility workers  pg&e, edison want to trim costs by laying off thousands, cutting service  bernadette tansey, chronicle staff writer state regulators are set to decide today whether debt-ridden pacific gas and  electric co. and southern california edison can conserve cash by laying off  thousands of workers and letting service standards slip.  union officials who protested the layoffs before the california public  utilities commission warn that if the cuts go through, neighborhoods hit by  power outages could stay dark for hours, and more customers could face busy  signals when they call about their bills.  an administrative law judge agreed, advising the commission in february to  order the utilities to restore 725 positions already cut and block the  judge john wong said pg&e and edison have acknowledged the layoffs will not  substantially improve their shaky financial condition, which arose from  skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs the utilities could not pass on to  consumers under a rate cap.  ""the savings would barely make a dent,"" wong said in his draft decision. the  two companies together claim that their debt from power purchases amounts to  wong's recommendation is already running into resistance on the puc.  commissioner richard bilas said the five-member panel should not be  micromanaging the utilities in a time of crisis.  bilas has proposed an alternate ruling that would allow the utilities to make  the cuts, but provide for puc monitoring of service in case the commission  wants to step in later.  ""we're in a situation where the utilities are not collecting the revenues  they need to operate, and yet we may be guilty of not letting them cut  expenses where they can cut expenses,"" bilas said.  pg&e spokesman jon tremayne said savings from the layoffs are helping to keep  electricity running and gas flowing.  ""it keeps cash in our accounts so we can keep doing day-to-day business,""  tremayne said.  additional 675 during the next three to six months. the cuts affect temporary  and contract workers who read meters, handle new service hookups and replace  equipment. pg&e has no plans to eliminate permanent positions.  the company is struggling to keep up with a higher workload at its call  center as customers deluge the lines with inquiries about their rising bills  and the effects of deregulation. calls to pg&e ballooned from 1.3 million in  bilas advocates granting pg&e's request to temporarily relax standards  requiring the utility to respond swiftly to customer calls and to read  customers' meters once a month. pg&e wants to read meters bimonthly and send  bills based on the estimated use between readings. discrepancies could be  corrected later.  wong called those measures unacceptable. he said customers need to know  immediately if their efforts to conserve power are working. wong also said  the utilities' own experts have said the workforce reductions will lengthen  the time required to restore power after nonemergency equipment failure.  eric wolfe, communications director for the international brotherhood of  electrical workers, local 1245, said some customers have already been left  without power overnight because pg&e is trying to avoid the use of overtime  on nonemergency power outages.  ""it hurts a lineman to walk away from the job leaving a customer without  power,"" wolfe said.  tremayne said pg&e is trying to minimize overtime costs, but denied the  company has allowed customers to go without power out of financial concerns.  he said crews were pulled out when darkness and falling trees made the work  too dangerous. power prices could soar during the summer  by steve johnson  mercury news  unless gov. gray davis arranges significantly more long-term electricity  contracts or persuades people to turn off a lot more lights, california's  unpredictable spot market for power could wreak havoc this summer.  even with the 40 long-term deals announced by davis on monday, experts  interviewed tuesday said, up to 43 percent of the state's daily needs may  have to come from this highly volatile market, in which power is bought  within a day of need. that could could prove hugely expensive, because some  spot market energy has cost five to six times what it would under the  long-term contracts.  it's widely expected that consumers ultimately would have to pay that tab,  which could amount to billions of dollars.  and because that power won't be locked up in contracts, there is no guarantee  it will be available when it's needed, which could lead to blackouts,  according to a recent report to the california independent system operator,  which oversees three-fourths of the state's power grid.  ``the situation in california could reach catastrophic proportions,'' the  report concluded, adding that unless things change dramatically, ``it is a  virtual certainty that peak demand will go unmet during many hot summer  steven maviglio, davis' press secretary, conceded tuesday that the spot  the state is trying to line up more power contracts, speed up power plant  construction and promote conservation.  during the normally hot month of august, peak daily demand for power in the  independent system operator's territory is expected to hit about 47,700  the state's three main utility firms generate about 8,200 megawatts and have  long-term contracts from wind, solar and other energy sources for about  power that davis has announced for this summer, and the state is still nearly  costly proposition  if all that power has to be obtained on the spot market, the price could be  high. on friday, last-minute purchases on the market averaged $411 per  megawatt-hour, compared to about $150 per megawatt-hour for all power  obtained by the independent system operator and $69 per megawatt-hour on  average under davis' long-term contracts.  california also might be able to trade for another 5,000 megawatts with the  federal government's bonneville power administration and a hydroelectric  operator in british columbia, said arthur o'donnell, editor of california  energy markets, a trade publication.  under such deals, those two outfits often send that much power to california  when they don't need it and california returns the same amount or more when  its demand is low.  this summer, because ``they still haven't gotten the snowpack they need in  the pacific northwest,'' which could limit that region's generating capacity.  still falling short  even if those hydropower imports are available and conservation works as  davis hopes, it's likely california would still require the spot market for  the state's overall power needs.  ``all of the surrounding states are buying probably less than 5 percent, at  most, of their energy on the spot market,'' said frank wolak, a stanford  economist, who monitors electricity prices for the independent system  operator. he worries about how much that power could cost and is disturbed  that state officials haven't adequately addressed the issue.  officials at pacific gas & electric co. are particularly concerned. they fear  of the spot market purchases by the independent system operator, which has  threatened to bill the utilities for the cost.  wants the tab sent to the department of water resources, which also is buying  power on the spot market for the state. but the department of water resources  has objected to that idea and the matter is expected to be heard today by the  california public utilities commission.  market will work ``and certainly that's one of them,'' said thomas hannigan,  the water agency's director.  added pg&e spokesman john nelson. but nettie hoge, executive director of the  utility reform network in san francisco, said she suspects consumers  ultimately will foot the bill.  the unfortunate likelihood about spot market purchases is that ``ratepayers  problem.'' power plant plans cause conflicts  east county residents blast supervisors  jason b. johnson, chronicle staff writer industry dreams of building new power plants in east contra costa's hills are  prompting an angry reaction among residents and elected officials who say  they don't want more plants.  the conflict was sparked by a vote by county supervisors yesterday to  aggressively explore possible sites for new power plants throughout the  county.  the measure by supervisors mark desaulnier and federal glover, which passed  on a 4-to-0 vote, directs the county administrator and department of  community development to compile a report on possible sites within 45 days.  supervisor donna gerber abstained after criticizing the plan for potentially  repeating the same mistakes that plagued the state's energy deregulation  effort by not considering how much energy the state, region and county will  need in future years, and how much power is slated to come online.  gerber said alternative power sources, such as solar, should also be  examined.  a site drawing much attention is on top of a deposit of natural gas near the  concord naval weapons station off highway 4.  the owners of 70 acres of land near the station recently formed a company,  golden state power co., to pursue construction of at least one small peaker  plant and a much larger facility capable of producing 600 megawatts.  the site could hold up to three small 50-megawatt peaker plants, and a larger  15-acre natural gas plant, said steve thomas, managing partner with golden

""i think we need  to stop and think about what we're doing to our quality of life.""  would be alarmingly close to the proposed golden state site.  home on that hill to be surrounded by power plants.""  there are six power plants in operation in east contra costa.  pittsburg already has two power plants, and two more under construction. city  council members frank aiello and yvonne beals said the antioch-pittsburg area  has done more than its share of energy production.  aiello said pittsburg will soon produce enough energy to power three million  homes in california.  ""when is enough, enough?"" asked aiello. ""pittsburg has shouldered  responsibility for a land-fill and two more power plants. at some point you  beals said that while power plants have added millions to the city's general  fund, the negatives of additional plants could outweigh the benefits.  ""i don't think that pittsburg or east county should be the dumping ground for  energy for california,"" said beals. supervisors set search for power plant sites  the board also heard from the potential developers of a 650-megawatt plant  between bay point and concord  by thomas peele times staff writer  toward allowing the construction of at least one small power plant before  summer, ordering that its staff identify potential sites in unincorporated  areas within seven weeks.  the board voted 4-0 to search for locations. third district supervisor donna  gerber abstained, saying her colleagues lacked a ""comprehensive context'' to  identify sites. ""i think the board knows just enough to be dangerous,'' she  said.  gerber said the county should examine the potential for additional power  plants within its borders but not investigate individual sites yet.  but fourth district supervisor mark desaulnier said the action was necessary  because of the energy crisis and because of gov. gray davis' call for local  governments to help speed the construction of so-called ""peaker plants""  before july and august.  ""i wouldn't do this except under an emergency,"" desaulnier said after the  vote. ""there are unusual circumstances. we're not talking about putting this  in a residential area.""  fifth district supervisor federal glover backed desaulnier, but said he hoped  for a location outside his heavily industrialized east county district.  said.  desaulnier said, though, that the only logical place for a small plant  remains the ""industrial belt'' stretching along the waterfront from west  county to antioch. he declined to provide specifics, but said the only other  potential site outside the industrial areas was the concord naval weapons  station property. but he quickly added that he believes the u.s. department  also, desaulnier said he could not rule out the county building the plant  itself and entering the electricity-selling market during peak demand times.  board chairwoman gayle uilkema called that idea extremely premature and  unlikely. ""that's a very powerful decision. i do not think we are ready,''  she said.  the california energy commission listed the equilon refinery in martinez as  peaker plants kick in during peak usage times. davis called for their quick  construction before the height of summer and its energy demand for air  conditioning.  approval. desaulnier said he believed a peaker plant could be built about a  month after final approval.  supervisors also heard from the potential developers of a 650-megawatt plant  between bay point and concord. walnut creek commercial real estate developer  steve thomas announced his intentions for the site north of highway 4 last  week. construction could take two years.  eric hasseltine, a consultant representing thomas and what he described as a  ""brand new"" company for the site, the golden state power co., told  supervisors that if they intended to speed peaker plant construction they  should do what they can to expedite the larger plant. the thomas site could  house a peaker plant until the proposed larger one goes online.  a large natural gas line passes under the site.  desaulnier seemed cautious about the larger proposal, which he had described  last week as ""a good site."" uilkema, too, said she knew too little about it  to comment.  a resident who lives near the thomas property asked the board to ""build it  (the larger plant) closer to where you have industrial areas. you have to  carefully consider the people"" who live nearby, said dan torres, 39.  evelyn freitas of concord said she lives downwind of the proposed site. ""our  gerber played on the environmental issues, saying the county already ranks  second statewide to los angeles in volume of hazardous materials and amount  of electrical generation. peter schrag: california's $90 billion infrastructure gap by now, california's surreal energy mess has grown from a crisis to a  condition. it may not be quite as permanent as, say, death and taxes, but  it's still something that could get a whole lot worse before it gets better.  until there's more realistic pricing, no gubernatorial pea-under-the-shell  buyout scheme will solve it.  beyond the energy crisis, however, and in many ways similar to it, california  seem, once again, to be all but forgotten.  the business roundtable has estimated the need at roughly $90 billion, though  no number can possibly be exact. what's certain is that after a burst of  but you probably don't need to tell anyone driving bay area or los angeles  freeways or looking at the ubiquitous portable classrooms, those dreary brown  boxes that house a fourth of our public school students. ever since passage  maintenance.  as in the state's electricity crisis, however, there's no way california can  effectively address those problems merely by building or bonding itself out  of them. in highway construction, in developing water resources, in finding  enough university space to accommodate the tidal wave ii of students,  managing demand is likely to be as crucial to any solution as new  construction.  familiar principle ever since david roe of the environmental defense fund  first persuaded pacific gas and electric that a dollar invested in  conservation may be worth as much as the same investment in new generation.  but in most other sectors of california's infrastructure, state and local,  it's a lesson still to be learned. there have been scattered attempts to  use, for example, through the installation of low-flow faucets and low-flush  toilets; some reduction in traffic by using rush-hour diamond lanes or by  adjusting highway or (as in new york) bridge tolls to levels of congestion.  but as pointed out by david dowall, an urban economist at berkeley, state  policy-makers have not really begun to ""consider how demand management  strategies can be applied to infrastructure service areas,"" or how the more  in any case, says dowall in one of the ppic reports, we should pick which  major projects we will build not just according to per capita estimates of  how much we need, but according to how much consumers are willing to pay for  them.  to avoid hurting the poor, congestion-related highway tolls and other tariffs  can be rebated on the basis of income. university fees can be means-tested.  in california, they also could be adjusted to encourage summer school classes  and other off-peak uses, rather than (as in the past) making uc summer  courses more expensive.  given the political and economic uncertainties, there's no way to know how  far such demand management can be taken. but there's not much doubt that, as  dowall and others point out, the state's infrastructure planning is a jumble  of uncoordinated agency agendas and wish lists.  the legislature last year passed a bill, ab 1473, by assembly speaker robert  hertzberg, that requires the governor, beginning next year, to submit an  annual five-year infrastructure plan for state agencies and public schools,  along with recommendations on how to fund it. in addition, gov. gray davis'  infrastructure commission is expected to recommend better coordination of  infrastructure and land-use planning when it issues its report this spring.  that would be a start. as california state treasurer phil angelides has  long commutes; to preserve open space; and to bring jobs to where people live  and housing to where the jobs are. that would itself reduce demand for more  freeway lanes and, equally important, improve the quality of life.  at present, most planning for housing, roads, water systems and other  facilities rarely recognizes the regional impact of local decisions. in the  east bay, slow-growth forces push well-intended initiatives that would force  more development into tracy or modesto and further tax the transportation  systems to silicon valley. in city after city, there are beggar-thy-neighbor  efforts to grab yet another shopping mall that produces a little extra sales  tax revenue for the city that gets it, and that often compounds traffic and  revenue problems in adjacent communities.  in higher education we divide bond proceeds evenly among uc, the california  state university and the community colleges even though the community  colleges serve eight times as many students as uc. we plan road projects  according to county, not regional, priorities. it is all done according to  antiquated political and fiscal formulas that often no longer make sense. we  don't just need better capital planning; we need a whole new planning system. pg&e power plan debated at hearing a puc meeting on the utility's capacity expansion project for the tri-valley  follows weeks of protest from officials, residents  power upgrade in valley debated  by megan long times staff writer  subdivision faced questions tuesday about their opposition to alternative  by restating their long-standing objections.  tuesday's cross-examination came during the third and likely final week of  the california public utility commission's evidentiary hearings on the  followed weeks of protests of pg&e's upgrade plans by officials and residents  of livermore, pleasanton, dublin and san ramon.  and before the questioning started, dublin vice mayor janet lockhart  reiterated concerns about an alternative route deemed ""environmentally  superior"" that would place a substation just 1,000 feet north of interstate  580 between tassajara and fallon roads. she said that would undermine the  results of a 15-year process to plan the eastern development of the city.  ""it's extremely important to the residents of our community to follow a plan  we worked hard to produce,"" she said.  dublin officials favor pg&e's proposed placement of the station three miles  north of the freeway, away from new high-tech company offices and housing  developments. besides the dublin substation, the project calls for  construction of a substation in north livermore, expansion of the pleasanton  substation and installation of 23.5 miles of new lines.  in response to questions from puc administrative law judge michelle cooke,  dublin's public works director, lee thompson, confirmed that the lin family,  the owner of the property where the alternative substation would go, wasn't  interested in selling the land to pg&e.  cooke also asked thompson to define a ""discretionary permit,"" which is how  city officials said they might treat a permit for a substation. lee said that  type of permit is one the city has the right to approve or not depending on  the project's impact.  eddie peabody, dublin's community development director, testified that the  zoning for the lin property accommodates uses such as commercial business,  research and development and light manufacturing. it would not, he said, be  appropriate for a power substation.  he said parcels within the east dublin area that could host a station would  include those zoned for public and semi-public uses, including land recently  bought by oracle and sun microsystems for new campuses.  while dublin officials testified that one buyer of land in that area paid $86  per square foot, others suggested land prices would be inflated to help make  a pg&e land buy look prohibitively expensive.  an executive of centex homes, the developer of new houses near isabel avenue  and concannon boulevard, objected to an alternative route that would place  high-voltage transmission lines overhead along isabel and stanley boulevard.  david barclay, president of centex's northern california division, said that  of the prima tract.  ed o'neill, a lawyer for the kottinger ranch homeowners association, pointed  out that existing distribution lines on 50-foot poles on isabel already mar  the view for residents.  the foley family has been ranching on land south of pleasanton city limits  for years, said their attorney kennedy richardson. the utility's project  would place overhead lines and a transmission station on rolling hills that  the family envisions as one day being public open space with limited  development, richardson said.  lawyers for pleasanton, livermore, kottinger ranch and centex are scheduled  to cross-examine a pg&e engineer today about the project's routing. that  testimony should be the most controversial of the hearings. judge cooke is  expected to recommend an alignment by july to the puc, which will make the  final decision. news  state oks 'peaker' power plant at sfo / temporary generator could be sending  marshall wilson the san francisco chronicle  final  state energy officials yesterday approved plans to build a temporary  electrical plant at san francisco international airport that should generate  meeting in sacramento, the energy commission voted 4-0 to give the green  light to the gas-fired plant. it will operate during peak summer and winter  demand to help the state avoid stage 3 power alerts and rolling blackouts.  texas-based el paso merchant energy co. won approval under a new state law  mandating speedy, four-month reviews of so-called ""peaker"" plants. it was the  only one of seven applications statewide to win approval. the other proposals  were withdrawn for various reasons.  the 51-megawatt plant, formally called the united golden gate power project,  is scheduled to be built at the northwest corner of the airport near the  united airlines maintenance center.  $400 million plant in the same area, company spokesman jesse frederick said.  it would undergo a separate review by state energy officials.  the small ""peaker"" plant approved yesterday is to generate electricity  beginning around aug. 1 for up to three years. after the end of three years,  the plant would be closed or converted to a cleaner-burning system. under  state law, a temporary ""peaker"" plant is permitted to spew more air pollution  than a permanent plant.  el paso's temporary plant is to be built next to a co-generation plant  operated by united airlines. it would use existing connections for natural  gas and water supplies and tap into existing power transmission lines.  electricity generated by the plant would be pumped into the state's  electrical grid, energy commission spokesman gary fay said. it would also  serve as a backup for san francisco airport in case of a blackout.  no one spoke against the proposed plant at yesterday's commission meeting.  the proposal, however, has been criticized by area residents and  environmentalists worried about air pollution.  scott buschman, a professional photographer and san bruno resident, said  yesterday it was unjust that state officials 100 miles away in sacramento  approved a texas company's proposal to put a power plant on land owned by san  francisco.  ""the fact that they approved it without considering the public's concerns,  foremost air quality, is very disturbing,"" he said.  fay said the plant complies with clean-air standards.  answering the criticism about the location of yesterday's deliberation, he  said three hearings and several workshops were held in communities near the  airport.  crossed wires: major kinks emerge in gov. davis's plan to power california  by wall street journal staff reporters rebecca smith, mitchel benson and john  r. emshwiller the wall street journal biggest bet in the history of the nation's biggest state: that he could tame  an out-of-control electricity market and avoid devastating blackouts without  busting the state's budget, antagonizing its consumers or derailing his own  political career.  his wager is still on the table, but the assumptions that underlie it are  looking increasingly shaky these days. the governor has already spent around  $2 billion of public money buying hugely expensive wholesale power, taking  over the role formerly played by the state's near-bankrupt electric  utilities. and california will probably be obliged to spend billions more  before its electricity market stabilizes and those utilities are restored to  some semblance of financial health. under the governor's plan, california aims to recoup the money it is using to  buy electricity by issuing $10 billion in bonds. that way it would still have  a healthy budget surplus to finance new spending on roads, schools and other  public services. but there's a potentially big obstacle to this plan. the  state legislature, worried about racking up billions in new debt, has put  limits on the size of any bond offering. in broad terms, the legislature's  action would allow the state to borrow only four times as much as it can  recover annually from utility customers.  right now that doesn't appear to be much. under the current rate structure,  essentially set in place by california's flawed 1996 electricity-deregulation  plan, consumers pay far less for power than the cost of acquiring it on the  wholesale market. preliminary estimates submitted by utilities last month to  the california public utilities commission show the state's share of the  proceeds from electricity sales this year could be as little as $241 million  legislature's formula.  that would leave the state on the hook for much of the money it has already  spend. that, in turn, raises the prospect that california's economy and its  credit rating both could deteriorate significantly. but state finance  officials say that, based on their own projections, they will be able to  extract enough money to support a $10 billion bond issue.  walking a careful line between fiscal prudence and political survival, mr.  davis and others in his administration are scrambling to come up with ways to  get around the legislative restrictions without raising rates for consumers.  davis says.  the governor says he believes that the state can obtain enough affordable  power through long-term power-supply contracts to avoid the need for a big  rate increase. the billions of dollars the state hopes to borrow would be  used to help pay for power until electricity prices drop, as they are  expected to do when new power plants come online over the next few years.  to seek new electricity laws through a statewide ballot initiative during  next year's election. that's when mr. davis is expected to run for a second  term as governor.  but trying to save california without rate increases is forcing mr. davis to  make some colossal gambles with the state's money. state officials estimate  that in the next several months, california will need to spend as much as $6  surplus. mr. davis is also looking to spend several billion more to buy the  transmission assets of three investor-owned utilities in order to restore two  of them to credit-worthiness. he also has announced plans to spend several  hundred million dollars more on conservation programs designed to reduce  demand while new power plants are being built in the state.  in order to limit the state's financial exposure in the meantime, the  governor and his aides have, in some cases, ignored state law. they have  threatened appointed officials who have stood in the way. and they have  sharply restricted the flow of information to the public.  none of those steps is expected to do much to reduce state spending on power  in the coming months. in a few weeks, power usage is expected to begin a  sharp seasonal rise as californians switch on their air conditioners with the  coming of warmer weather. by various estimates, demand during peak periods  this summer could outstrip supply by 10%, or several thousand megawatts. that  could produce more rolling blackouts like the ones that hit northern  california earlier this year. it is also likely to put strong upward pressure  on wholesale electricity prices.  steven zimmerman, managing director of standard & poor's corp., says mr.  financial exposure to the crisis. the credit-rating agency has put the state  on credit watch for a possible downgrade, which would affect the value of all  of california's outstanding public debt. moody's investor service inc. is  also concerned. it said in a recent report that the power crisis could soon  ""seriously threaten the health"" of the state's economy.  mr. davis, a democrat and career politician, was dealt a bad hand when he  electricity crisis was enacted under his predecessor, republican pete wilson.  but mr. davis was slow to react to early signs of trouble this past summer  and alarms sounded by members of the state legislature. by the time mr. davis  finally sprang into action earlier this year, a troublesome power-supply  squeeze had escalated into a crisis.  in a jan. 17 declaration of emergency, the governor designated the state  department of water resources to take the utilities' place as the daily buyer  of huge quantities of electricity. his hope: that by making the state the  dominant player in california's power sector, he would ease electricity  producers' concerns about getting paid and give the state enough clout to  negotiate lower long-term power prices.  earlier this week, mr. davis announced final or tentative agreements with 20  periods of as long as 20 years. but the supply situation remains extremely  uncertain for this summer, when demand probably will top 45,000 megawatts. if  the state can secure enough power under contract and push down demand through  aggressive conservation, it might be able to squeak through the summer  season. if not, it will be forced to keep buying huge amounts of costly power  in the cash market.  under deregulation, retail electric rates were frozen for several years,  while wholesale-power costs were free to fluctuate. when the plan was  conceived, wholesale prices were low and expected to go lower. however, a  combination of unexpected growth in power demand and a lack of new generating  capacity helped produce a supply squeeze. average wholesale prices more than  a year earlier.  & electric unit of pg&e corp. and the southern california edison subsidiary  up billions of dollars in wholesale power bills they couldn't afford to pay.  as generators began shying away from selling to the two utilities, the  clinton administration forced them to sell power into the california market,  an order left in place during the first weeks of the bush administration.  still, northern california was hit by rolling blackouts on several days in  early january.  since then, the dwr, which does some electricity trading as an adjunct to its  main mission of managing the state's giant system of aqueducts and  reservoirs, has had to learn the ins and outs of power markets on the run. it  hasn't been easy.  david mills, trading-floor manager for the federal bonneville power  per megawatt hour more than the available market price. ""they agree to prices  that make you wonder,"" says mr. mills, whose organization markets electricity  from federal dams in the pacific northwest. ""you'd at least think they'd  check to see what the prevailing price is before throwing out their offer.""  mr. mills says that ""to cut california some slack,"" he occasionally has  instructed his traders to sell at prices lower than the dwr had offered to  pay.  ray hart, the water agency deputy director responsible for the power  purchasing, says he isn't aware of any cases in which the dwr has overpaid.  he says his team has been ""extremely successful by all measures.""  ultimately, the dwr's trading acumen is far less important than the overall  arithmetic of power supply and demand in california. with the price of  natural gas that feeds many of the region's generating plants at near record  levels and some suppliers reluctant to sell into the troubled california  market, wholesale electric prices remain stubbornly high and, in recent days,  have again been rising.  the legislature has advanced the dwr about $3 billion from the state's  general fund for power purchases. under emergency legislation passed by the  legislature and signed by mr. davis on feb. 1, the general fund is to be  reimbursed from a planned bond sale later this year. but under terms of the  emergency law, the water agency would have to wrest $2.5 billion a year in  revenue from retail electricity rates in order to sell the $10 billion worth  of bonds sought by mr. davis.  assembly speaker robert hertzberg, a southern california democrat, says the  formula was created to ensure that there would be a way to repay the bonds  without draining the state's coffers. ""we didn't want to just open our  wallets,"" he says.  according to the language of the feb. 1 law, the water agency gets what's  left of revenue collected from ratepayers after the utilities pay certain of  their own power-supply bills and other expenses. and, in their filings with  the puc last month, the utilities reckoned, under their worst-case scenarios,  state officials are quietly pushing the puc to rejigger the formula so that  terms of the feb. 1 law. robert miyashiro, deputy director of the department  of finance, says the emergency law was ""drafted poorly"" and has led people to  believe the dwr ""only gets the leftover money."" he predicts there will be  ""cleanup legislation.""  at the request of the davis administration, the puc is considering a plan to  use a different revenue-sharing formula than the one in the state law. the  proposed new formula was written ""in close consultation"" with mr. davis's  finance department, says puc president loretta lynch, who supports the  initiative and is hoping to rush it through.  the effort has drawn some opposition. commissioner richard bilas at a recent  puc meeting questioned the legality of the commission attempting to change a  formula set by the legislature. pg&e is even more emphatic, since the dwr's  extra money could come at the utility's expense. the formula ""threatens to  undo the very financial protections for the utilities that [the new law]  attempted to provide,"" the utility said in a recent filing with the puc.  as politicians and regulators wrestle with that issue, the davis  administration has taken a step to reduce the outflow of state cash that also  seems to conflict with the feb. 1 law. it was widely assumed that the law  required the dwr to buy any electricity the state needed to keep its lights  on. however, on many occasions, the dwr has refused to buy power on the  grounds that it was too expensive, citing a portion of the new law that urges  the agency to hold down costs.  the task of covering any remaining shortfall has passed to the california  independent system operator, which manages the state's energy grid and is  charged with buying power when necessary to avert shortages. however, the iso  doesn't have any power-purchasing money of its own, and the major parties it  would normally bill are pg&e and edison, whose inability to pay their power  bills was the reason the state started buying electricity in the first place.  amid criticism of its stance from generators, utilities and wall street, the  dwr says it has started covering more of the utilities' electricity costs.  day, says the agency's mr. hart. but increased buying only adds to the  uncertainty about the eventual tab.  the state's legislative analyst, elizabeth hill, recently recommended that  lawmakers hold off considering more than $2 billion in state spending on  items ranging from college construction to beach cleanups because of  continuing questions about the financial impact of the electricity crisis.  like others, ms. hill complains that the governor's office and state agencies  haven't been forthcoming with information.  indeed, the dwr refuses to say precisely how much power it is purchasing and  at what prices, though it has on several occasions gone back to the  legislature for more money. state officials say that data on its purchasing  activities would give suppliers an advantage in continuing electricity-supply  contract talks.  state controller kathleen connell, who is running for mayor of los angeles in  an april election, recently announced plans to post state power-spending  information on her department's web site. but within 24 hours, ms. connell  suspended that plan after discussions with senior davis administration  officials. ""i feel very strongly that this information should be publicly  released,"" says ms. connell. ""i just don't want to do anything that would  weaken the state's effectiveness in negotiating.""  in an effort to more tightly control events, the governor obtained  legislative approval to abolish the 26-member iso board, which was made up of  everyone from utility executives to representatives of consumer groups. he  then appointed a new five-member board. to ensure a quick transition, the  california attorney general threatened the old board members with fines of as  much as $5,000 each if they didn't immediately relinquish their positions.  all did. ""i was offended"" at the ""heavy-handed"" treatment, says karen  johanson, a former iso board member.  electricity crisis. the former iso board routinely held such meetings in  public. iso attorneys say the meeting was largely designed as a private  briefing for new board members and that the organization is committed to  keeping its deliberations as open as possible. the wall street journal and  other news organizations have unsuccessfully challenged the closure in  sacramento state court.",0

(in response to a question, blake later said that ferc had largely addressed the access issue or would do so.) 3.	on reliability, he was given a chance to say that doe supports th nerc ""consensus"" language, but instead repeated that the administration favors ""enforceable reliability standards"" but wants to work with the committee on the exact language.  i took this as confirmation of what we have heard informally from doe in terms of key players there not being enamored of the nerc ""consensus"" approach, at least as it exists in its old, long form. 4.	sens. craig and cantwell pushed blake on why the administration has not fully supported bpa's request for a debt limit increase to finance expansion of the bpa grid.  blake said they support the bpa expansion projects, but that omb feels bpa has enough borrowing authority through 2003.  this did not sit well with craig and cantwell.  i spoke with sen. craig in the hall, following up on a conversation i had with him the other evening about bpa, and he stressed that he is committed to getting bpa the debt limit it needs.  as you know, commercial has asked us to help bpa given matters pending between enron and bpa. 5.	on the first private sector panel, even john rowe, the co-ceo of exelon and past eei chairman (testifying for his company and eei), said several times that there should be strong rtos that each cover a wide idea.  he said his board voted yesterday to sell its transmission assets if a strong, independent operator could be found.  rowe also said that rtos should be ""encouraged"" (implying not mandatory?).  the appa witness was strong on rtos, saying that all entities will be part of rtos even without legislation.  nreca said that co-ops would oppose federal jurisdiction over them and that they favor voluntary rtos.  epsa made the usual case for competition, open access, rtos, etc.",0

""the administration has fired its shot, and now we're firing ours,"" said  edmund b. rice, president of the coalition for employment through exports, an  industry group that is leading the effort.  since they got wind of the proposed cuts a few weeks ago, business lobbyists  have been trying to rally sympathetic lawmakers. and executives at boeing,  suppliers that benefit indirectly from the $12.6 billion of export loans,  guarantees and insurance that ex-im bank provided in the last fiscal year.  those small companies, the executives hope, will create a groundswell of  support in congress for the ex-im bank.  ""companies large and small who have similar interests here are banding  together to provide an educational effort so people understand the impact of  this,"" said chris hansen, boeing senior vice president for government  relations.  corporate lobbyists also have dug up a speech that vice president dick  cheney, while chief executive of halliburton, gave in 1997 praising the bank  and scoffing at those who consider it a giveaway to big business. they plan  to pass mr. cheney's comments to influential members of congress this week.

""that makes it a  much more serious issue,"" mr. rice said. ""we're concerned that the  administration seems to be turning its attention in this direction.""  barring intervention from mr. cheney, business groups now have largely given  up hope of convincing the white house to back down, planning instead to use  their muscle to convince congress to restore the ex-im bank's funding. bank  officials and u.s. companies argue that, far from being a subsidy, the bank  simply allows american companies to compete with european and japanese firms  that receive assistance from their own governments.

(u.ene), duke energy corp. (duk), e.on ag  selling gas, sourced in the u.k., the netherlands and norway, in a number of  hubs between emden in germany and emshaven and oude statenzijl in the  netherlands.  david gallagher, head of european gas trading at enron in london, estimates  contract is done at the oude statenzijl hub, where the gasunie pipeline  system connects to the network of wingas gmbh.  an important element kick-starting short-term trading was the sale, in  contract to five dutch-based power generators.  robert van der hoeven, head of fuel procurement at electrabel, the owner of  dutch generator epon, said his company uses most of the gas it imports from  norway for its plants in the netherlands and trades the rest on a short-term  basis in the oude-emden area. this pattern is common to the other dutch-based  parties to that contract.  trading in dutch hubs received a further boost when nederlandse gasunie nv  (n.neg) decided, after months of wrangling with regulator dte, to lower its  commodity and service tariff, the so-called css system, from july 2001.  gasunie now claims its pipeline system is fully open and transparent. to  critics say the switching figure doesn't necessarily indicate an ideal system  of third-party access.  according to energy consultants the brattle group, around half of the gas  used by alternative suppliers goes through the 1 bcm/year zebra pipeline from  zelzate to zeeland, which was built by dutch utilities a few years ago  precisely because gasunie refused to provide access on favorable terms.  shippers have complained that the hourly system used by gasunie to balance  the pipeline system raises the overall cost of shipping through its network  significantly. gasunie imposes a balancing charge which effectively forces  shippers to pay for the extra gas brought into the system from storage sites,  in addition to the capacity and transmission price. critics say gasunie has  so far failed to unbundle these charges, although it agreed to do so in  january.  according to the brattle group, another controversial aspect of gasunie's  tariff system is that it is based on theoretical costs of constructing new  pipelines rather than its actual costs.  the dte is also considering ways of reforming the storage system to make it  competitive. bp plc (u.bp) and nederlandse aardolie maatschappij nv operate  storage facilities and lease capacity to gasunie through long-term contracts.  the regulator is studying ways of allowing third parties access to storage  facilities. gasunie has so far shown little sign of negotiating more  competitive tariffs with storage operators and passing on the benefits to  customers, critics say.  the growth of short-term trading in the dutch gas market is also inevitably  linked to its potential as a transit country for gas coming from the  u.k.-belgium gas interconnector and going towards the 82bcm-a-year german  market.  market participants say liquidity at the emden and oude hubs has grown  considerably since e.on and rwe started trading there earlier this year.  however, the obstructive attitude of incumbents toward third-party access  there has meant that so far most gas traded in the netherlands has remained  there.  reuters english news service new york, march 7 (reuters) - america's largest exporters are launching an  aggressive lobbying campaign on capitol hill to protect the export-import  bank from budget reductions, the wall street journal reported in its online  edition on wednesday.  the exporters, including boeing co. , caterpillar inc. , enron corp. ,  halliburton co. and others, are angry and confused that a republican  administration has targeted one of their favourite programmes for big cuts,  the paper reported. ex-im bank officials were not talking publicly, avoiding the appearance that  they are battling the white house to overturn the proposed 25 percent cut in  the bank's $865 million operating budget for the current fiscal year, which  the white house labels the ex-im bank as corporate welfare.

""trust me,"" craver said in a phone call after the conference. ""there are a  bloody nightmare.""  the disclosure comes at a time when an increasing number of power suppliers  are suing the utility for millions in unpaid bills.  edison also disclosed tuesday that two more lawsuits had landed in its lap -  one by a group of wind-powered generators including enron wind, the other by  two suppliers including new york-based caithness energy.  both suits were filed during the past five days, edison assistant general  counsel barbara reeves said. it was not immediately clear how much the  complainants were seeking; neither enron nor caithness returned calls for  comment.  the two filings bring the total number of suits by renewable-energy suppliers  against edison to four, the utility said. the city of long beach and  calenergy operating group, a geothermal supplier, have also sued for back  payments.  calenergy alone has said it is owed $45 million in november and december  payments.  the line sale, part of a multifaceted, tentative deal with the state that  could save edison from insolvency, could take anywhere from several months  into next year, craver said.  the tentative deal, announced by gov. gray davis feb. 23, calls for the state  to pay more than twice the book value for edison's lines.  it also would require edison to sell cheap power to the state for a decade  and for edison to end its lawsuit against state regulators. the suit asserts  that price caps imposed by the california public utilities commission are  illegal under federal law.  additionally, edison's parent would have to return $420 million it collected  from the utility over the past several years. the money was used to pay debt,  buy back stock and pay dividends to investors.  sce, pg&e and sempra have complained they are near bankruptcy because of  soaring prices on the open market combined with the state-imposed price caps  for consumers.  sempra and pg&e have yet to announce similar line-sale deals with the state,  though they and the governor have said negotiations are ongoing. the total  billion. sierra pacific ceo doubts sec ok of enron unit buy-report dow jones energy service los angeles -(dow jones)- sierra pacific resources (srp) ceo walter higgins  acquisition of enron corp.'s (ene) utility portland general electric will be  approved by the federal securities and exchange commission, the las vegas sun  reported tuesday.  the sec must find that sierra pacific is in a strong financial position  before it will approve the deal, but the company is currently weakened by  having lost millions of dollars in fuel and purchased power costs, higgins  said in the report. said that money would only pay back those expenses and wouldn't improve the  company's stability to a level the sec would find adequate, according to the  report.  the public utilities commission can halt the rate hike and order refunds if  it decides the hike isn't necessary. the puc is holding hearings to determine  the prudency of the hike, and members of the state's powerful casino and  mining industries have filed to intervene.  sierra pacific's plan to shore up its financial position through the sale of  state senate is considering a bill to block the sales, and nevada gov. kenny  guinn recently sent a letter to the puc asking that it reconsider its order  allowing electric utilities to sell assets.  financial analysts have said that not allowing sierra pacific's two utilities  to sell their assets would have a ripple effect on the company's financial  position. the asset sales are tied to low-priced power contracts, and if the  sales are canceled, the low-priced power will be gone as well.  ""if the divestiture is stopped...the state may be dealing with a much bigger  rate increase,"" steve fleishman, merrill lynch utility analyst, told dow  jones newswires recently.  sierra pacific is the parent company of electric utilities sierra pacific  power co. and nevada power, which serve customers in the state's north and  south, respectively.  many power deals announced by california governor still not final by jason leopold dow jones business news dow jones newswires  california gov. gray davis this week remain under negotiation or are the  the lack of finality to the deals raises questions about the state's success  in covering its power needs, particularly going into what is expected to be  an unusually tight summer.  generators said privately they were surprised the governor went ahead with  his announcement monday, given that many of the contracts haven't been  signed.  david freeman, general manager of the los angeles department of water and  power, who negotiated the contracts on behalf of the state, conceded that  details remain to be worked out. ""this is not a done deal,"" mr. freeman said,  adding that credit concerns are keeping generators from signing the deals.  gov. davis announced monday that california has secured 40 long-term  contracts that will provide california with about 629 million megawatt hours  hour is roughly the amount of electricity needed to power 1,000 homes.  several of those forward deals, however, involve contracts originally held by  edison international (eix) unit southern california edison and pg&e corp.  (pcg) unit pacific gas & electric at the california power exchange,  previously the state's main power market.  the governor seized those contracts earlier this year, just before the power  exchange liquidated them to cover hundreds of millions of dollars in power  bills the utilities had failed to pay.  the contracts, which total about 1.3 million megawatt hours of electricity  and have a market value of about $1 billion, according to market sources,  one of the suppliers that sold the contracts to pacific gas and socal ed, has  sued gov. davis for unlawfully commandeering those contracts.  although duke has reached an interim settlement to continue providing power  to the state department of water resources until april 30, the company and  the davis administration still have to ""develop a comprehensive long-term  settlement to pay for the power supply contracts,"" said duke spokesman tom  williams.  the governor went ahead with the announcement, because the california  department of water resources believes it will be able to finalize and sign  the contracts over the next several weeks, davis spokesman steve maviglio  said.  including duke, reliant energy inc. (rei), mirant corp. (mir), sempra energy,  agreements with the state, although negotiations were ongoing.  ""we are working in good faith with the dwr toward a long-term contract,"" said  art larson, spokesman for sempra energy resources, a unit of sempra. mr.  larson said sempra signed a terms of agreement with the water-resources  department and expects to reach a final agreement over the next several  weeks.  reliant said it has only signed a short-term contract with the state that  expires in about two weeks. the company will only sign a long-term contract  spokesman richard wheatley said.  mirant said it also won't sign contracts with the state until it's paid.  enron said it's reached agreement on terms with the state, but has some  credit-related details to hammer out. ""everything's been agreed to except for  some credit technicalities,"" enron spokesman mark palmer said.  meanwhile, small, independent power plants in california that are capable of  generating 1,800 megawatts of power are shut down because their owners  haven't been paid by the state's two main utilities, the california  independent system operator said tuesday.  the decline in small-plant output has contributed to the state's power-supply  problems the past two months. partnerships involving el paso corp. (epg), for  example, shut down 350 megawatts of generation last weekend due to  nonpayment, the company said tuesday.  socal ed hasn't paid the owners of the smaller generators, known as  ""qualifying facilities,"" since early december, which means the generators are  still owed for electric production in october, while pg&e has paid only a  small percentage of its qualifying facility bills since its last full payment  in early january.  the plants, one-third of which are powered by renewable sources like wind and  solar power, meet almost 30% of california's electricity needs. almost all of  the closed generators are fueled by natural gas, and many haven't been able  to pay their gas suppliers and have been cut off from their gas supply.  the california senate energy committee plans to vote on legislation to create  a new pricing system for all qualifying facilities this week. the proposed  bill would cut the prices to qualifying facilities from about 17 cents a  kilowatt-hour the past eight months to about eight cents, depending on the  price of five-year natural-gas contracts the generators can sign. the plants  that run on renewable resources would be paid 5.4 cents a kilowatt-hour.  write to jason leopold at   all rights reserved us natural gas prices fall as demand slips in most areas dow jones energy service houston -(dow jones)- u.s. natural gas physical prices fell tuesday as demand  eased, except in the northeast and southeast areas of the country, traders  said.  heavy snowstorms in the upper northeast supported some pricing, as did cooler  weather in georgia, the carolinas and the florida panhandle. some storage buying occurred in texas ""if they could make it work,"" a trader  said.  ""it was a pretty uneventful day,"" a gulf coast trader said late tuesday.  also, because of the snowstorm in the northeast, traders had purchased gas  ahead of time to make up for needed load, he said.  a scheduled work outage on enron's transwestern san juan lateral in new  mexico was completed, and the return of a power plant in california  alleviated demand in the west, traders said.  british thermal units, west coast traders said, down as much as $15 from  monday.  in the midwest, chicago citygate prices fell 7 cents-8 cents to a range of  the nymex april natural gas futures contract settled at $5.315/mmbtu, down  2.1 cents in a tight, range-bound, uneventful session that started late due  to bad weather.  physical gas prices at the benchmark henry hub in south louisiana ended in a  transcontinental gas pipe line at station 65 deals were made in a similar ",0

""the cost of power produced by modern plants is all within a mil  (one-thousandth of a dollar),"" said michael peevey, an adviser to gov. gray  davis and former president of southern california edison. so the extraction of profit in the electricity business relies much more on  better, rising sharply. little regulation but despite the obvious temptation to manipulate the market, the burgeoning  electricity trading business has remained largely unregulated. the federal energy regulatory commission does require quarterly filings from  energy traders, but these often provide incomplete information, or at least  little that has been of concern to ferc. in fact, although the trading of electricity grew more than a hundredfold  trader. after the onset of the california crisis last year, ferc has acted  once. that was against williams, which agreed to pay $8 million without  admitting guilt to resolve an allegation that it withheld supply to pump up  prices. ferc's record of enforcement in the area of power trading stands in contrast  to a long list of enforcement actions within other markets taken by the  securities exchange commission and the commodity futures trading commission. ferc has recently added staff to its market oversight operations. but william  massey, a ferc commissioner, says the agency's effort is still inadequate. ""electricity can be flipped, stripped and chopped up,"" massey said. ""it's an  extraordinarily complicated market. ""the sophisticated marketers and traders have simply moved past us. we're  kind of horse and buggy in our approach and they're out there in rocket ships  flying around ... the problem is that sophisticated traders don't necessarily  produce reasonable prices. they produce profits."" before deregulation, electricity trading was a low-key affair. regulated  utilities dealt power back and forth on a reciprocal basis to fill  electricity shortfalls in their control areas. there was little trading for  profit until the mid-1990s, after federal legislation and ferc rulings opened  the market. major traders include large energy companies, sister companies of  california's major utilities and wall street firms. market volatility in many ways, the trading of power is similar to that of other commodities.  but there are important differences. because it cannot be stored and its use  is so fundamental, the price of electricity is the most volatile of all. when supplies are tight, a single supplier can rapidly raise prices to  budget-busting levels, as evidenced by duke energy's recent admission that it  charged california nearly $4,000 for a megawatt-hour of power, a quantity  that probably sold hours earlier for one-tenth of that sum or less. wolak, the stanford economist, and state sen. joseph dunn, d-garden grove,  who is investigating the state power market, say trading allows companies to  collude under the guise of competition. instead of wringing out lowest costs,  the wholesale trading market serves to raise prices, they say. ""as i trade to you and you trade to me, we communicate to each other what  communicating price."" mark palmer, a spokesman for enron, the nation's biggest power trader, said  california's problem is not the result of trading. ""it's a result of shortages,"" palmer said. underscoring its emphasis on trading, enron's new headquarters tower in  downtown houston rises from a six-story block of new trading floors,  including expanded space for electricity trading. enron also pioneered trading in cyberspace and its enron online site claims  to be the most active computer-based trading market. the houston company argues that consumers won't fully benefit from power  trading and deregulation until they have greater choice in choosing their  power supplier. and the company says ferc has not done enough to open access  to transmission lines, which would allow traders to move power around the  country. to that end, enron has lobbied hard for president bush's plan for a  national electricity grid. palmer says the notion that the price of electricity rises each time it is  traded is mistaken. ""the market is always looking for the real price of a commodity,"" palmer said. dunn, the california state senator, says his investigation found a different  function for trading. at a time when supply barely meets or falls short of  demand, he noted, companies with electricity to sell have to worry only about  how high to set their price. ""trading develops a level of trust. you, my alleged competitor, will bid in  the same patterns and i will respond not in a competitive pattern but in a  complimentary pattern."" the state senator said his investigation found evidence that on several days,  energy companies appeared to test their ability to drive prices up, without  being undercut by competitors. this ability to drive up prices without competitive consequence is a key test  of market power, the technical term for manipulation or price fixing. but dunn also conceded that antitrust violations can be hard to prove in  court. he suggested that even if the trading behavior falls short of  antitrust violations, it remains anti-competitive and devastating for the  california economy. to harry trebing, a utility industry expert and professor emeritus at  michigan state university, wholesale electricity trading is reminiscent of  created complex networks of holding companies that traded stock among  themselves, driving up prices in the process. undoing that scheme was a focus of president franklin roosevelt's  administration. congress ended up barring national power companies and  tightening regulation of utilities, in an effort to counteract their tendency  to create markets that work only for insiders.

"privileged and confidential this email contains legal advice hoyt and melissa, i am assuming that we are discussing contract personnel who provide some sort  of services for mg/rw.  it looks like there may be some key personnel we want  really familiar with the specific facts here. the question of a joint employer arises when a company treats its contract  activities, engaging in promotion/discipline/termination, etc. decisions, and  other ways in which an employer treats its own employees.  so, if the plan is  to have workers doing the same thing, with one as a contractor, and one as an  employee, there could be some issues, particularly if they share a  supervisor.  unfortunately, that often is the case with contract personnel. if there are distinctions among the various responsibilities of these workers  is cleanest, however, to use all of these workers through the contracting  alternative).  then, the company may want to make selected offers to people  who may be in a managerial role or have some other distinction from the bulk  of the contract workers. i would like additional information on this situation before reaching a  definitive conclusion.  so, let's try to discuss it.  i am booked until about  11 this morning, but am available after that. michelle hoyt thomas@enron bath la michelle, i guess emails will get to you sooner if i remember to add you to  the addressee list!  sorry. hoyt hoyt thomas melissa, my concern is that we may get hit with what is called a  ""co-employment suit"" in the us.  this is where an agency employee claims that  he/she was treated like an employee, therefore he/she should get employee  benefits (vs. benefits from the agency company, which are probably weak).   since we did a share purchase of mg, if the agency employees filed a suit  against mg claiming that they are really employees, i think that we would  have to defend it. i am not an attorney, but i am going to send this to michelle cash, who can  advise us on the position we should take.  i would think that if we single  out certain employees to become enron employees and the remainder stay as  agency employees, this would enhance the legal position of the agency  employees (versus everyone staying as an agency employee).  michelle, can you  help us with this one?  thanks. melissa, i also think we should minimize distribution on this discussion . .  	enron europe hi hoyt, i have today spoken to ed dablin regarding henry bath la.  we discussed how  the employees seem to feel that they are enron employees, although they are  infact agency workers.  ed confirmed that martha and half a dozen other  employees quite clearly should become enron employees and should get  applicable benefits. the other employees (who are mainly manual employees) he does not feel should  become enron employees and should remain as agency staff. he realises that the original granting of share options has slightly ""muddied  the water"" with regard to whether these employees are employees of enron or  the agency.  he was not involved with the original decision to grant these  employees share options. we discussed the issues (in broad terms, as i could not remember all of the  specific issues) and he is aware that making a limited number of individuals  enron employees, whilst the others remain agency workers, is not an easy  however, this is his ideal scenario.  how viable is it that we can do this  he also made the point that martha is the most senior executive in henry bath  inc. and is one of his most valuable employees. regards melissa",0

"lorraine, here are a few notes from my review of the val verde contract, and  my initial impressions.  let's talk more about how to approach the issue  after we meet with ron tomorrow about maop. sec. 1.3 specifies pressures and states that unless there is an agreement to  interruptible basis. sec. 2 states that the blanco hub maop shall not be exceeded. sec. 4.2 limits damages (no consequential damages). the contract also has a fairly standard force majeure clause. sec. 3 obligates tw to provide firm compression service in order to accept  juan expansion is effective. my initial conclusions:  it is pretty clear we have an obligation to accept  requirements.  probably the only way we can avoid this obligation is if  argue impossibility of performance.  also, we could avoid the obligation  because the summer heat above certain temperatures constitutes force  majeure.  this argument is strengthened by the fact that temperatures seem to  have gotten hotter over the years.   the fact that we entered into our most recent agreement with burlington in  january of this year weakens the credibility of our arguments (they will say  we should have known by now).  burlington might try to argue that we have an  absolute obligation to comply with the agreement, even if it means expensive  system modifications.  that argument is not a very strong one because the  agreement contains no such affirmative obligation and in fact quite clearly ",0

"i attended cmmr. wood's two-day hearing on wholesale markets, which concluded  and neeper) with duque and bilas participating by phone.  administrative law  judge wetzel was present and a transcript was taken.  the quasi-legislative  hearing was the beginning of a record developed for the investigation into  the workings of wholesale/retail markets.  this session focused on wholesale  markets.  there will be subsequent sessions on retail issues, market  structure and other related issues in the future.  my conclusion from this  session is that wood is looking for support for increasing regulatory  intervention in the market. dan larcamp, director of the office of markets, tariffs and rates, ferc, was  present.  he relayed ferc's concern of this matter and a desire to hold  hearings in san diego.  he also relayed that hoecker held a press conference  announcing the opening of a 206 investigative proceeding into the operation  of the wholesale markets in california, which carried with it refund  authority. the format of the hearing was to respond to pre-filed questions developed by  wood/lynch.  each member of the panel would respond to the questions and any  questions posed by the commissioners, the judge or the cpuc attorney.  no  questions were posed by members of the audience.  yesterday's panel of  academics were comprised of: 1.  dr. timothy duane-uc berkley 2.  dr. william hogan-harvard 3.  dr. frank wolak-stanford (iso market surveillance committee) 4.  david marcus-energy consultant for the coaltion of utility employees 6.  dr. jean-michel glachant, universite paris i pantheon sorbonne the panel was asked to speak as individuals and not on behalf of any  institutions they may represent.  while the purpose of the panel seemed to be  to determine that market power was being exercised and that prices were too  high and therefore not just and reasonable, the panelist stopped short of  blaming generators and market participants in behaving illegally.  the  concensus generally was that market power did exist at various times, but the  mere existence did not constitute bad behavior.  none, with the exception of  dr. wolak who is in the process of doing a study using recent data as part of  his role for the market surveillance committee, had done a study.  there was  some discussion, though not much, of the monopsony power of the utilities.  i  think ultimately the group conceded that scarcity of supply amplified  concerns about the exercise of market power, as even the increase in gas  costs did not fully explain the recent spikes.  wolak believes that encourage  utilities to enter into forward purchases will reduce the exercise of  real-time market power.  hogan seemed to be there with sempra's interests in mind.  he continued to  promote expansion of the iso's abilities to dispatch load as well as maintain  system reliability.  there was alot of discussion about forward purchase  the concerns were also discussed about the appropriateness of a distribution  utility making purchasing decisions on behalf of its customers.  this  included discussion of separation of these functions and the default provider  most everyone agreed that rolling back to a regulated market was not feasible  without raising other major and serious concerns, however there seemed to be  support for some interim measures where cost-of-service regulation may be a  good idea and that was during peak periods.  all agreed that a demand  response, and price signals, are important in the long-run, although not to  the extent currently experienced in san diego. today's panel included representatives from sdg&e, sce and pg&e, turn, ucan  while yesterday's panel maintained objectivity as to whether or not  generators were exercising market power to the detriment of the system,  today's panel made no bones about the generators being to blame. sce/pg&e indicated their need for relief for recovery of market costs in  excess of the rate freeze.  sdg&e was still on the hot seat for their  inaction in hedging any of their supply.  sdg&e brought up their failed pbr  proposal and ora and ucan thought that that may be one way to incent the  utility to be more responsible with their purchases. ucan discussed the governor's direction and the potential for putting rate  caps into affect for residential and small commercial.  he mentioned that c&i  customers are experience difficulties as well.   turn raised the need for cost-based bid caps and cost-based peaking  contracts.  mike florio, turn, urged against any further divestitute of  assets and alleged market concentration on those assets that had been  divested.  in fact, turn urged the commission to seek legislation to clarify  the commission's authority to order retention of assets. neeper urged that part of the solution should be changing the current  requirement to use the px as the only authorized exchange, although turn  disagreed.   bruno gaillard chris

found an author because of the efforts of enron and others lobbying  against it. furthermore there are signs that gov. davis opposes it. 2. the governor's office has issued a proposed language for a rate cap bill.  the language however is not available as of yet. it may be released today or  tomorrow. sdg&e has shown concerns over the content of the bill. they seem to  think that it is worse than initially proposed by the governor in his press  release.  energy component the bill does not specify who or how the costs associated with the cap will  be recovered. (the reasoning is that udcs will be more cautious in their  procurement if there is uncertainty on who is responsible for the costs.) all of this is speculative. we hope to see the actual language soon. 3. enron has been working with the republican leadership to promote a rate  cap proposal similar to the amended language we have proposed for ab2290. the bill focuses only on sdg&e customers and our major principals are the  following.  the interim rate cap should be limited to residential and small commercial  customers, plus specific institutions that have a significant public role,  such as schools and hospitals.   the interim rate cap must be structured so that any undercollection is  eventually recovered from the same customers who benefit from the lower rates  provided by the rate cap.

"fyi.  from today's post.  davis seems to continue to put distance between  himself and the contracts. best, jeff financial  california changes stance on refunds; two sides far apart in energy talks peter behr the washington post  final  copyright 2001, the washington post co. all rights reserved  california officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to  recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity , saying  they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43  billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year.  seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term  contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for  davis.  ""we've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get  ""you can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. however you  the new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a  california settlement being conducted in washington by federal energy  regulatory commission judge curtis l. wagner jr., according to sources close  to the negotiations.  yesterday, wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the  amount of overcharges if california officials and the generators cannot reach  a compromise.  may offer a preliminary assessment."" the settlement conference is set to  conclude on monday.  wagner, ferc's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides  toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy.  mountainous energy prices have bankrupted california 's largest utility,  drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put davis at  sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on.  last friday, wagner rebuked davis's chief representative, michael kahn,  refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said.  wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for  all sides, is closed to the public and media.  wagner complained last month that kahn was following a political agenda, and  his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a ""joke"" that the  parties might as well wear ""clown suits,"" according to a dow jones report  confirmed by sources close to the talks.  but he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by reliant  energy inc., williams energy services, duke energy and southern co., for  failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. the suppliers  various california lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said.  wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to ferc's  commissioners. ferc has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but  now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of california 's  electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher  refund figure, some energy analysts believe.  davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an  overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have  to pay for energy under those deals.  california 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed  deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at  volatile ""spot market"" prices. when energy costs shot upward last summer, so  did the state's electricity bills.  in response, davis's aide, s. david freeman, and his staff began negotiating  long-term power contacts with suppliers. the $43 billion in deals signed so  considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy  analysts say.  a new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political  pressure on davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's  controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. davis will argue that  reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count  as a ""refund"" because the deals were reached ""under commercial duress,""  according to sources close to wagner's negotiations.  industry supporters say davis's refund figure is impossible to justify.  ""there's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be,"" said  michael zenger, california director of cambridge energy research associates.  the state's advocates counter that if ferc enforced a ""just and reasonable""  standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the  overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure.  ""it's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate,""  said frank wolak, a stanford university economist who heads an oversight  committee for the california grid.  those polar-opposite views have left both sides in wagner's conference room  ""billions of dollars apart,"" as the talks approached their final weekend,  sources said.

(ap) via newsedge corporation  - gov. kenny guinn signed a bill wednesday that would stop the sale of nevada power plants, halt deregulation and bail out struggling utilities with a new rate system. the senate and assembly gave the measure final approval earlier in the day and rushed it to the governor. the bill was crafted to keep nevada from suffering from a power crisis similar to california's. utility executive, as he signed the bill into law. ``nothing can control escalating costs, but we're in the best position to protect ourselves.'' legislators made a last-minute change to add language that ensured consumers would get a break on rates if utilities profit from sales of excess power to other states. guinn said the bill takes care of the most pressing energy issues, but other deregulation-related bills are sure to follow. that includes a plan that would allow major power users, such as casinos and mines, to buy power on the open market. legislators also are working on plans encouraging energy conservation and ensuring the poor can pay their utility bills. pg&e co. issues statements on the increase in the state's cost for power electric company there seems to have been some confusion yesterday over the effect pacific gas and electric company's bankruptcy filing may have had on energy prices. i thought it might be helpful to provide a few useful facts and figures, to help you pin down the truth behind what may be driving the state's energy costs higher. yesterday, governor davis claimed that the state was paying roughly $20 million more for electricity every day as a direct result of the bankruptcy filing by pg&amp;e. while it's understandable, even laudable, that the governor would want to fully explain the downsides of utility bankruptcy, this claim is simply not accurate. the governor should know better. consider the facts: below investment grade by every major rating agency. generators immediately raised concerns about continuing to sell power to such non-creditworthy entities. department of water resources to make $400 million in power purchases. less than two weeks later, on february 1, the governor signed ab1x, which authorized dwr to buy power on an ongoing basis at least through 2002, until the utilities could be restored to creditworthiness. the clear understanding in the legislative debate was that the dwr would purchase the full ""net open position"", which is the amount of additional generation needed, beyond what the utilities themselves own or have under contract, to meet customer demand. however, a few weeks later, in spite of the clear intent of state law, it was revealed that dwr was not buying the full net open position, and had no intention of doing so. it was only buying power that it considered ""reasonably priced"" and was leaving the iso to buy whatever was necessary to keep the 20-percent of the state's daily electricity need. along the costs of these last-minute, high-cost, spot-market purchases to the state's non-creditworthy utilities (despite existing ferc tariffs which precluded the iso from doing so). pg&amp;e has estimated that its share of these costs was roughly for sure, because we haven't seen the bill. the dwr won't say how much power it's buying, and at what cost, and neither will the iso.) informed the independent system operator that it could not force generators to sell to non-creditworthy entities (namely, both pg&amp;e and sce). this order appeared to force the dwr to purchase the full net open after all. the iso responded the next day with its own interpretation of the ferc order, saying the order was limited to ""emergency"" power only. the iso also sought and obtained in federal court a temporary restraining order (issued by judge damrell), forcing generators to continue selling to it. ferc seeking to clarify that the iso's interpretation of the february 14 order was contrary to ferc's intent. damrell's lower court order affecting one of the generators, reliant, saying the generator was no longer required to sell electricity to the iso without assurances of payment. presumably this order would apply to other generators, if they sought such assurances. filing that one of the reasons for the decision was the ""financial exposure to unreimbursed wholesale energy procurement costs"" caused by the state's failure to assume the full procurement responsibility. an order responding to the generators' feb. 22 complaint against the iso. in this new order, ferc reaffirmed its february 14 order that the iso could only buy power on behalf of creditworthy entities, meaning neither pg&amp;e nor sce. office acknowledged the state's ""bill for energy purchases will increase by upward of $8 million a day after a ruling last week by the federal energy regulatory commission,"" once dwr started buying the full net open position, rather than force the iso to try to bill the utilities. it seems likely utilities' costs, not the combination of both. publishing the total amount it spent on energy the day before. buying the full net open position. on april 13, in response to sent a ""murky"" notice to generators promising that ""any bid accepted by the iso will be deemed to have the financial support of another qualified party or dwr as specified in this notice."" generators were reportedly underwhelmed by the assurances contained in the letter. was driving up the state's costs, gary ackerman, spokesman for the western power trading forum, said ""i don't believe, nor have i ever heard, of a bankruptcy surcharge being added to the cost of power.... if anything, i think that generators and marketers would take solace in the fact that bankruptcy brings order to an otherwise volatile situation."" what does it all mean? clearly, the increase in the state's costs have come as a result of the dwr finally covering the state's energy needs, as promised in ab1x. this change in dwr's buying habits has that the iso only sell to creditworthy entities. these orders were issued independent of pg&amp;e's bankruptcy filing and apply equally to neither pg&amp;e nor sce have been creditworthy since mid-january, when their credit ratings were reduced to below investment grade, and the dwr, iso and governor's office have been aware of the effect of the ferc order since mid-february. some generators have suggested that california has been paying a credit penalty since december, when the utilities' deteriorating financial situation gave rise to payment concerns. there appears to be far more evidence that the state's coy approach to ab1x implementation has created far more uncertainty in the marketplace than has pg&amp;e's chapter 11 filing. j.d. power and associates reports/ nationwide decline in

"california officials investigate electric 'megawatt laundering' steve johnson , san jose mercury news, calif. prices, state authorities have heard stories about a curious phenomenon: on days when the weather is hot, batches of power generated in california are  sold to other states. a little later in the day, similar amounts of power are  the question is, is it the same power? if so, that could be ""megawatt  price cap, which covers power generated in california but not power sold into  california from elsewhere. worried that such transactions could be costing consumers millions of  dollars, several energy specialists raised concerns about megawatt laundering  during a federal energy regulatory commission hearing a month ago in san  formally asked the commission to investigate the practice, which he termed  ""potentially illegal market coordination."" but an unconfirmed news report last week said the federal agency had  concluded that generators had not abused the market. and others say concerns  about megawatt laundering are exaggerated. among them is jan smutny-jones, executive director of the independent energy  producers association, a power-firm trade group, and chairman of the  independent system operator, which oversees most of california's power grid. while acknowledging that such laundering is possible, smutny-jones said there  is no evidence it is actually occurring or is widespread. ""this is one of those things that's turning into an urban legend,"" he said.  ""i don't want to characterize this as a significant problem."" even some critics of the way power is purchased in california concede that  most of what has been labeled megawatt laundering probably reflects nothing  more sinister than the ability of some entrepreneurs to take advantage of a  good deal when they see one. nonetheless, they see evidence that at least some california-produced power  is being sold out of and back into the state at a higher price. and they  blame that on loopholes in the system that they say ought to be closed  because the transactions are helping to drive up the cost of power. the independent system operator ""invites this type of activity,"" said frank  wolak, a stanford economist who chairs the non-profit corporation's market  surveillance committee, which has warned of the potential for megawatt  laundering in at least two reports this year. ""the thing that makes all these  problems go is the fact that the iso has said, `we'll pay whatever it takes  to keep the lights on,' and that's screwing consumers big time."" in 1998, when the state's energy markets were deregulated, it was generally  assumed that opening up the sale of electricity to competition would make  power less expensive. as a precaution, however, officials at the independent  system operator instituted wholesale price caps, which they lowered twice  this summer to help keep a lid on costs. on july 1 this year, they reduced  unfortunately, things haven't worked out the way officials had hoped.  wholesale prices rose dramatically this year. and while a freeze on retail  utility rates has temporarily shielded pacific gas & electric co. customers  from those soaring costs, home electricity prices have tripled in san diego,  where a similar freeze already has come off. in the process, some generators learned that all it takes to get around the  state's wholesale price caps is a basic understanding of how the market  works. one of the best ways to get top dollar, they learned, was to hold off  selling their electricity until the independent system operator issues what  is known as an out-of-market call for energy, which amounts to an emergency  request for electricity. from may through september this year, the overall price of power in the state  averaged less than $125 per megawatt hour, according to authorities. but over  the same period, power sold in response to out-of-market calls averaged more  during the summer, when energy use is at a maximum, california typically  imports about one-fourth of the power it uses from other states. since power  generated by firms in other states isn't limited by california's price cap,  those companies generally are in a better position than california firms to  make a killing on out-of-market sales. but by cutting a deal with a  collaborator in another state, energy specialists say, california generators  say a california generator has 100 megawatts. instead of selling it in  california, where the firm can receive no more than $250 per megawatt hour  under the current cap, it finds a utility, an electricity broker or a  corporate affiliate with an equal amount of power in another state, such as  other firm to do a trade. under the deal, the california generator sends its 100 megawatts for one hour  difference. the potential profit from such deals is considerable. generators in and out  of california received more than $110 million from out-of-market sales this  summer, according to the independent system operator. but determining if  megawatt laundering is really happening, how often and who might be  benefiting, is difficult. one california investigator said authorities first suspected that megawatt  laundering was occurring when they noticed that precisely the same amount of  power was being sold to another state and then sold back into california  minutes later. but other experts said the evidence has rarely been that  clear. while hundreds of megawatts is sold into and out of the state on any  given day, they said, the suspicion that firms were conspiring to sell the  same power back and forth has stemmed largely from unfounded speculation. one big problem for investigators trying to learn if the system has been  abused is that confidentiality rules keep many of the details about these  electricity transactions private. ""entities like us and others who may be suffering from the consequences of  this laundering don't necessarily have the documents"" to prove it, said gary  stern, director of market monitoring for southern california edison, one of  the state's three main utilities. ""we can only speculate based on things  we've heard from others about the practice....it's our hope that's one of the  things that's being examined"" by the various federal and state agencies  investigating this summer's extraordinary rise in california power prices. indeed, while some people say megawatt laundering can be substantially  limited by ending the practice of paying more than the wholesale cap for  out-of-state power, others argue that it's just as important to eliminate the  secrecy surrounding electricity transactions. ""i'd like to see more information"" made public, said jim bushnell, a  researcher at the university of california energy institute in berkeley, who  specializes in analyzing the state's energy markets. ""there are a lot of  rumors circulating around this,"" he said of megawatt laundering, ""and it  would help clarify if this is a serious problem."" to see more of the san jose mercury news, or to subscribe to the newspaper,  go to http://www.sjmercury.com",0

""i would  cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says `hi my name is spike,  honey,'"" adds mr. lockyer. houston-based enron is a major energy-trading  company. like other such firms, enron has denied wrongdoing in the california  market.  mark palmer, enron's vice president for corporate communications, said mr.  lockyer's comment about mr. lay ""is so counterproductive that it doesn't  merit a response.""  investigators and academics say there is abundant evidence that individual  firms have been exercising ""market power."" this term is used to denote  efforts to influence wholesale-electricity prices, such as by withholding  supplies. the california independent system operator, or iso, which manages  the state's electric transmission grid, estimates that by exercising market  power, suppliers may have added about $6.8 billion to the cost of electricity  in the state since early last year.  a single firm exercising such power isn't necessarily illegal, says severin  borenstein, director of the university of california energy institute. if a  company is a large supplier in the state and ""you're not exercising market  power, you are not doing your job"" on behalf of shareholders, he says.  mr. borenstein and others say that there are steps that should be taken  against suppliers. they note that under federal power law, the federal energy  regulatory commission can order refunds for wholesale prices that are above  ""just and reasonable"" levels. so far, ferc has tentatively ordered california  suppliers to make tens of millions of dollars of such refunds, as part of  that agency's ongoing inquiry into the california market. critics of the  suppliers and ferc say the refunds should be in the billions of dollars.  the power industry, not surprisingly, says there is nothing to accusations of  price manipulation or collusion. executives point to a botched  state-utility-deregulation plan that relies heavily on volatile spot-market  purchases. suppliers note that over the past decade, california didn't build  enough new power plants to keep up with demand growth. the allegations of  manipulation are ""a lot of sound and fury and they won't produce anything,""  says gary ackerman, executive director of the western power trading forum, an  industry trade group.  power generators also point to sharp increases in some of their costs,  particularly natural gas, which is a major power-plant fuel. this rise in  natural-gas prices also has set off a flurry of investigations over possible  of probes by federal and state officials. el paso denies any wrongdoing.  while power-industry officials say they have been cooperating with the  investigations, law-enforcement officials say they have hit some roadblocks.  for instance, mr. lockyer's office has gone to san francisco state court to  enforce subpoenas against reliant, houston-based dynegy inc., and southern  co. and mirant corp., both of atlanta, after the companies resisted turning  over certain business documents they deemed confidential.  investigators have zeroed in on the increased frequency with which plants are  going out of service for unscheduled outages. at times, several thousand  fewer megawatts of capacity are available than a year ago. a thousand  megawatts can power about one million homes.  generators say that this increased ""forced outage"" rate shows that tight  supplies over the past year have required them to run plants, some of them  more than 40 years old, for long periods without routine maintenance. this  combination has produced more breakdowns. ""plants have been running flat  out,"" says tom williams, a spokesman for duke energy co., charlotte, n.c.,  which says that its california power plants produced 50% more electricity in  at the same time, during periods of lower demand, the number of unplanned  outages often seems to rise enough to keep supplies tight, says frank wolak,  a stanford university professor and chairman of the iso's market surveillance  committee. ""clearly, something is going on here."" however, he and others say  that it is almost impossible to tell why a particular pipe failed or whether  such a failure was a legitimate reason to reduce output.  some of the most intriguing evidence to date about forced outages surfaced in  a federal case. ferc officials said an investigation had raised questions  about whether two major power companies had taken plants out of service in  order to reap higher electricity prices. the charges against aes corp.,  arlington, va., which owns the plants, and williams cos., tulsa, okla., which  markets their output, asserted that those actions allowed the companies to  in one instance, according to case filings, a williams employee ""indicated""  to aes officials that his firm wouldn't financially penalize aes for  extending an outage at one plant. this conversation, which was voluntarily  divulged by williams, could be an indication of collusion. williams and aes  settled the case without admitting any wrongdoing by paying back $8 million  to the iso and by taking certain other measures. a williams spokeswoman says  the employee who talked to aes was ""counseled not to enter into any  conversations of that nature"" in the future.  another issue raised by the ferc case touched on maintenance procedures.  according to the filings, aes stopped doing a certain procedure to keep its  plant's cooling system from getting clogged. the clogging of the system was  cited as a reason for one of the forced outages. mark woodruff, president of  the aes unit that operates the plant in question, says the company  substituted what it felt was an equally effective maintenance procedure.  if someone was looking to keep supplies tight and prices high, changes in  maintenance procedures would be an easy way to ensure that plants,  particularly old ones, have frequent forced outages, says a senior  utility-industry executive. by restricting maintenance resources, he says, an  operator can simply allow a plant ""to take itself out of service.""  journal link: what is california doing to alleviate the energy crisis? see a  video report of california state treasurer philip angelides discussing the  state's plans, in the online journal at wsj.com/journallinks.  in the year since california's energy deregulation plan began resulting in higher prices and even blackouts, a flurry of investigations has gotten under way. here are the main ones: agency: federal energy regulatory commission investigation: whether generators are charging more than ""just and reasonable"" rates as demanded by the federal power act; whether el paso corp. used its position as a major natural-gas supplier to the state to illegally drive up the price of fuel used to generate electricity. agency: california public utilities commission and the state attorney  general investigation: whether generators and power traders have acted illegally through collusion or other means to artificially inflate electricity prices. agency: puc and california independent system operator investigation: whether generation plants were shut down for spurious reasons in order to create supply shortages and, thus, to raise electricity prices. agency: california electricity oversight board investigation: whether patterns of bidding and pricing in california's electricity auction indicate collusive or otherwise illegal behavior. sources: state and federal agencies business/financial desk; section w enron unit moves to end india contract for power by saritha rai the new york times its bills, the enron corporation's indian power-generating venture served  formal notice on saturday that it would terminate its power supply contract  and pull out.  the move by the dabhol power company, 65 percent owned by enron, starts the  clock ticking on a six-month notice period before the contract is voided,  during which negotiations to settle the dispute are expected. the $2.9  billion dabhol project represents the largest single foreign investment in  india. separately, enron said today that it was withdrawing from a pipeline project  in qatar, which would have supplied some gas to dabhol. the company said that  the two steps were unrelated.  company and the governments of india and of the western indian state of  maharashtra. the state-owned utility company that contracted to buy power  from the dabhol plant has defaulted on some $64 million in unpaid power  bills, and has accused dabhol of charging too much.  dabhol said it was left with little choice but to issue the termination  notice after both governments failed to honor their contractual commitments  to buy and pay for its output.  but in a statement issued over the weekend, dabhol said it was ''still open  to constructive discussion on the solutions.'' the company said a ''lasting  and feasible solution'' to the dispute would require that the two governments  either honor their obligations to buy dabhol's power or find other  creditworthy buyers to take the power instead.  the first phase of the project now generates 740 megawatts of power, and the  second phase, adding another 1,444 megawatts of capacity, is scheduled to go  on line next month.  under the contract, the termination that enron has set in motion would oblige  the federal and state governments to pay damages to enron and the lenders  shut down. california; metro desk the state gop criticizes davis' choice of pr aides capitol: legislative  leaders call the pair political operatives who are too partisan to represent  the state during energy crisis. dan morain times staff writer los angeles times home edition consultants known for their highly partisan work.  labeling consultants mark fabiani and chris lehane as ""cut-throat,"" senate  gop leader jim brulte of rancho cucamonga and assembly republican leader dave  cox of fair oaks said in a letter to davis that the hiring ""undermines the  assertions you have made both publicly and privately throughout this crisis."" davis announced friday that he retained the duo and that the state will pay  ""we're not going to support the hiring of political hacks on government  payroll,"" brulte said in an interview.

""now it (electricity) cannot be at any cost,"" v.p. baligar, chairman and  managing director of the karnataka state power transmission corp ltd (kptcl),  the state's monopoly power distributor, told reuters in an interview late on  monday.  the move comes on the heels of the bitter wrangle in maharashtra state  involving dabhol power co, 65-percent owned by houston-based enron.  dabhol issued a preliminary notice on saturday to end a contract to sell  power to the maharashtra state electricity board. the step came after  maharashtra ceased payments saying dabhol's tariffs were too high.  showcase of india's decade-old reform programme but now is regarded by  critics as a symbol of policy bungling.

""our cost is the lowest cost approved (and) coal prices have fallen (since  the agreement),"" sharma told reuters from bombay. company officials say the  project is also looking forward to a federal guarantee to help it move  forward.  baligar said the government's intention was to weed out those who are not  serious. ""those who are serious can sit with us and sort out their problems,""  he said.  power tariffs vary, depending upon foreign exchange rates and the type and  prices of fuels. three projects which are already generating power get about  had comparable rates but mpc says falling coal prices helped its  competitiveness.  one generating firm, jindal tractabel, which uses coal and gas, gets about  regulatory approval. the state wants the jindal rate to be the benchmark for  reopened agreements.  if private firms cut capital costs and work out long-term fuel supplies, they  will be able to cut rates, baligar said.  over five years. state-run utilities are in a position to meet five-year  needs at low rates, baligar said.  asked if karnataka could face litigation over the reopening of the contracts,  india: india utility may slap 4bln rupee fine on enron unit. reuters english news service week after the u.s. energy giant took its first step to pull out of the  embattled project.  a senior official at the maharashtra state electricity board (mseb) said on  tuesday the fine on dabhol power company (dpc) was for not meeting capacity  targets within a stipulated period. official told reuters.  dpc officials declined to comment on the matter.  earlier this year, mseb had imposed a similar penalty on dpc -

that's only for starters. there is much more in the godbole report. on the  basis of a passing comment in an fipb meeting, that the project's costs were  broadly in line with other similar projects, the power secretary in new delhi  tells the central electricity authority that the cea's techno-economic  clearance is not required though this is statutorily mandated. the cea agrees  to this untenable proposition, but later issues a vaguely worded clearance on  the basis of a meeting whose minutes were not made available to the godbole  committee. the re-gasification project that was made part of the power  project had a capacity to handle 5 million tonnes, though dabhol itself  needed only 2.1 million tonnes. a port facility had similar excess capacity.  yet the entire cost of these facilities was loaded on to dabhol, along with  the full cost of the 20-year gas supply contract. thus, as the godbole  committee observes, what should have been a variable cost was converted to  part of the fixed cost, which mseb would have to service through a capacity  charge, whether any power or gas was bought or not. even the power  requirements of maharashtra were mis-calculated in order to over-ride a  warning from the world bank that the dabhol power would not be needed. this  was done by assuming that industrial demand for power would grow overnight at  twice the earlier rate, and that mseb itself would overnight see a dramatic  worsening of its operating parameters. there is still more in the report, but  the point should be obvious. what the report shows is that the dabhol  godbole committee recommend), on the grounds that it was improperly handled  and violative of law and common sense. if a favourable judicial decision  becomes possible, that should help mitigate the costs of winding up a truly  scandalous project. for reasons that are not clear, mseb and the maharashtra  government have chosen not to go down this route. perhaps they have greater  and continuing faith in the re-negotiation process. smartmoney.com: power grab by elizabeth harris dow jones news service new york -(dow jones)- feeling squeezed by rising electricity bills and  shrinking investment returns? consider investing in utilities, which posted  solid gains amid the recent bear-market carnage.  but plugging into this volatile sector is risky business, as anyone who piled  7.28% last year as demand for power outstripped supply, the average utilities  morningstar. though the sector's prospects remain attractive, such volatility is par for  the course, says mark beckwith, portfolio manager of the vanguard utilities  income fund (vgsux). utilities and funds that focus on the sector no longer  perform like bonds, delivering most of the gains via relatively predictable  dividend yields. instead, the industry has greater growth prospects (and the  correspondingly higher potential for losses) tied to the fluctuating demand  for power.  already, high prices for natural gas and electricity have created incentives  for producers to boost supplies. and the stodgy local monopolies that once  dominated the industry must now reckon with a bevy of independent producers,  distributors and traders. even telecom companies are now considered fair  game, offering managers of sector funds fresh choices alongside greater risk.  ""the classification of a utility has changed,"" beckwith says.  at the same time, the crisis gripping electricity-starved california is  showing other states the pitfalls to avoid as they deregulate their grids.  ""the outlook for wiser deregulation is very much with us,"" says bill reaves,  a manager of the strong american utilities fund (samux). the crisis out west  has also spurred construction of new power plants from new york to florida,  he adds. managers also count on continued political support from the former  oilmen in the white house who are determined to boost domestic output.  with such inducements in mind, we screened morningstar's database looking for  no-load utilities portfolios with one-year returns of at least 1% and  three-year annualized returns of 5% or more. we also sought funds with  initial investment minimums no higher than $3,000 and expense ratios below  the category's average.  strong american utilities  bill reaves, co-manager of the strong american utilities fund, characterizes  ""we try to concentrate in the electric and natural-gas area,"" reaves says.  ""we try to concentrate in holdings and companies where we see good growth.""  last year, that meant scaling back significantly from telecom stocks, in part  because of a deteriorating outlook.  resources (d) is the largest position. energy ranging from gas utilities to  integrated oil and gas companies has also been a significant holding, at  reaves and the rest of the portfolio management team are also very sensitive  to valuations. the portfolio consists of 40 stocks, but the managers can  best bargains.  this cautious approach has stood the fund well at a time when some of its  competitors got hit by telecoms' travails. the strong portfolio rose 27.33%  record.  reaves expects the good times to last, with industry earnings growth on the  five years. ""demand is likely to keep on being strong...and the value of the  service is going to be appreciated a great deal more,"" reaves says. for  example, the electric utilities' average price-to-earnings ratio for 2002 is  vanguard utilities income  ""we won't be moving with the nasdaq,"" says portfolio manager beckwith of the  vanguard utilities income fund he runs. beckwith invests a relatively small  that turned the tables on 1999, when the technology boom consigned vanguard  utilities to the rear echelon of its peer group. annualized over three years,  the portfolio has returned 9.33%, trailing the average utilities' fund's  here, too, the emphasis is on attractive valuations. beckwith also has a  mandate to invest at least 95% of the portfolio in dividend-paying utilities  as much growth as i can without taking on too much risk,"" beckwith says.  right now, beckwith has 61% of his assets in defensive electric utilities  such as dominion resources or the fpl group (fpl).  on continued strong demand for electricity. ""earnings momentum will be very  good for the group at least over the next year,"" he says. his main concern is  that high energy prices could encourage conservation, eventually depressing  demand.  american gas index fund  this concentrated portfolio rises and falls with the gas industry's  prospects. strong natural-gas prices boosted the american gas index fund's  like other index portfolios, the fund doesn't make stock picks; instead it  owns 73 members of the american gas association, representing much of the gas  distribution and transmission industry in most u.s. regions. stocks are

latest threat from enron, the us energy group, to pull out of its dabhol  power plant venture near bombay illustrates both the shambolic nature of  india's electricity system and the wider risks of investing in the country.  the project had serious drawbacks. but unless energy companies can expect a  commercial return, they will not invest in badly needed new infrastructure.  unless contracts are honoured, few foreign companies will consider india as a  place to do business.  		the maharashtra state electricity board, the dabhol plant's only customer, is  refusing to pay its bills, arguing that the tariffs are unjustifiably  inflated. prices are certainly high. the plant, fuelled by expensive naphtha,  is running way below capacity due to unexpectedly low demand, further  increasing unit costs. more difficult to judge is whether this is within the  terms of the contract, since enron is keeping the details confidential.  		the argument over unit costs, though, is in any case less relevant than it  might seem as most of india's state electricity boards, including  maharashtra's, operate at a large loss. many consumers pay highly subsidised  rates. many pay nothing. bills go uncollected. half of delhi's electricity  output is stolen, mostly to power middle-class air conditioners rather than  light bulbs for the poor. bankrupt state utilities are then periodically  bailed out to the detriment of spending on health and education.  		india's state authorities urgently need to introduce a common minimum tariff  and a more targeted form of subsidy. this may be unpopular, but the central  government's offer of dollars 5.6bn, raised via a bond issue, to pay off the  electricity boards' debts should sweeten the pill.  		a new pricing regime is only the first step. electricity generation,  transmission and distribution should be unbundled and privatised. contracts  should be awarded through competition, not by arrangement with the relevant  political party. this would require much more transparency than many of  india's politicians have been ready to concede.  		enron's difficulties over the dabhol plant, the largest foreign investment in  india, have persuaded other western companies to withdraw from similar  projects. this will hardly help the country to overcome the power shortages  that hinder economic development. but the effect will reverberate well beyond  the energy sector.  		india receives a pitifully small slice of the world's foreign direct  investment. infrastructure weaknesses are certainly one factor. but as  important is the readiness of indian politicians to manipulate foreign  business for their own ends.  		copyright: the financial times limited houston chronicle enron pulls out of venture drilling in qatar's waters  by laura goldberg  enron corp. is pulling out of a large natural gas project off qatar, the  company said monday.  plans for the dolphin project called for houston-based enron to work with  elf, a subsidiary of france's totalfinaelf, and the united arab emirates  offsets group to develop and pipe natural gas from a block of the qatar north  field.  more than a year ago those involved with the project said it could end up  requiring investments of up to $10 billion over six or seven years.  enron said monday it was transferring its 24.5 percent stake in the project  to the united arab emirates offsets group, which said in a news release it  had started negotiating with other international players to become  stakeholders.  with the transfer, united arab emirates offsets group will own 75.5 percent  of dolphin. terms of the deal weren't released.  enron pulled out for a couple reasons, including that it believes there are  better places to invest its money, said alex parsons, a company spokesman in  london.  the project doesn't necessarily fit with enron's current focus.  it is emphasizing businesses such as marketing and trading in wholesale  markets such as those for natural gas, electricity and broadband.  enron said it would consider future ventures with the united arab emirates  offsets group that were ""in line with our core business activities.""

a very depressing moment.  do you really it is good to have friends like steve.  they make the pain of separation so much easier. and steve, when you fpl guys get that entergy merger sorted out, in a dozen years or so, you let us know. i want to participate in the name selection for the new entity.  how about fentergy plus? others, i don't know quite how you manage to knock out all this material each week. the burrito is informative, humorous and usually contains a sprinkle of irony, tragedy (iso drama).  though you are usually neutral regarding the px, you are not unduly negative which i appreciate.  i think we do a pretty good job over here and so often people in the industry forget the amount effort and challenge it took the px to successfully open this market.=018 thanks, mark.  i just want you to know that my ability to write this stuff every week is not constrained by the facts or evidence.  i have learned from watching herr (hair?) peace, that as long as you can talk (write, too) fast, and have conviction in your statements, regardless of how groundless they may be, you will have a willing and eager audience. a few weeks ago, i received from the px=01,s jennifer sherwood a note, which she wants you to know are her opinions, not necessarily the px=01,s. that sham rose bowl bet, (remember?, stanford lost) and your opinions unleaded prices to high ca electricity prices?  what i mean is, we are up in arms about how we should protect the unfortunate san diego consumer who can't afford to keep the ac on. but what about the inflated unleaded gas prices the whole country has seen over the last few months?  no effort is made by the government to shield the consumer from how much it costs to fill their gas tank.  no mention is made of those who can't afford to drive to the grocery store because they can't afford consumer without pause.  granted there are differences between the unleaded market and the electricity market in terms of demand-side responsiveness, but then again is it that much different to say, =01+i can't drive today because gas is too expensive=01, finally, from one of our [secret] washington readers, and i am not telling who, i received the following: =01&i ... broke down and listened to the [iso governing board] discussion and vote.  ugh!  i too noted that the ""speak fast"" was applied to everyone but herr peace.  my goodness, volumes.  my sources at ferc tell me, though, that we should keep an eye out for {ferc chairman] hoecker to do something really ... [censored] ... for political reasons.  given no commission meetings til september, the only way to act is by unanimous consent, so i would hope he can't do several of you people commented to me that the iso=01,s reply to the puc/eob report was very good.  i decided to excerpt the best sections of website. certain generators on june 13 created frequency instability leading to the bay area blackouts the following day. in fact, the events of june 13 and june 14 were completely independent of one another. the voltage instability on june 14 was caused by system conditions on that day alone local area, and transmission constraints that prevented the import of generation from outside the area. rs to reduce demand in order to avoid the bay area blackouts. in fact, the iso had in place on june 14 a number of demand response programs designed to reduce load including the summer 2000 demand response program, under which customers have agreed, through a prior solicitation, to curtail energy use in exchange for a fee =01&the report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by billion in the month of june alone). these assertions leave one with the mistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid by the udcs and/or passed through to customers. however, in determining the total cost of energy, one must determine the impact of any forward contracts entered into by the udcs in advance of the wholesale energy price in advance of real-time or near real-time market activities, are specifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility, and are standard in all commodities markets. we have reason to believe that some of the udcs were substantially hedged during the period of the recent price spikes. may and june. this assertion assumes that all energy purchases would peak demand, when all of the state=01,s generation has been exhausted, the iso competes with neighboring regions for available generation. in order to secure the necessary power, the iso must purchase, on a bilateral basis, this energy from resources located outside of the iso=01,s control area. competitive=018 and implies, erroneously in our view, that this is the normal state of affairs. it is not. the market surveillance committee has noted that =01&market power in the california energy market appears to arise primarily during periods of peak demand,=018 and warned that demand growth would increase the incidence of market power during the summer of 2000. =01&the report asserts that the iso is answerable only to a self-interested board and not to the citizens of california. this simply is not the to the rules and regulations of ferc, which dictate, in part, that wholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the public interest. the iso further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed and approved by ferc. every change to our market design and virtually every the ferc process provides substantial opportunities for input by the state agencies and such agencies have, in fact, been active participants in the ferc proceedings. =01&the report asserts that california supply conditions have been affected by restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have made california more vulnerable to supply shortages. this assertion is unfounded. significant load growth in california and neighboring states coupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in both generation and transmission have caused this vulnerability. restructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many fold. only by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval and siting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements will this significant shortage be addressed.=018 if you want to imagine a scary sight, imagine, then, twelve california legislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongs of electric restructuring.  also imagine, as if you are in the twilight zone, witnesses that are slow on their feet, and reckless in their facts.  then you get a glimpse of what yesterday=01,s joint senate/assembly hearing was like. it started over two hours late.  the senate was busy congratulating one of their own who is term-limited out next session, and they wanted to heap on the glory.  that said, the show began with cec commissioner bill keese.  mr. keese has one story, and regardless how well he tells it, and he does, it is always the same story.  it is the heat storm story. one can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is a single-mom, call her lady-bird bowen, who travels across an angry land with her precocious pre-teen child, stevie wonderboy.  they are searching for electric power plants in the dessert, which, by the grace of god have been shipped to other countries which have more liberal returns on investment. being the first speaker, mr. keese took at least half the heat (storm) of the day.  the rage of the energy fuhrer was palpable.  last week, san not receive one penny of compensation (i=01,m not making that up ... he said it).  he is sick of hearing about demand management as being a solution for the problem over the last five years, and he is about done listening.  people in san diego are depressed by the sudden price hikes.  yikes! keese did mention that the california reserve margin has sunk to 7%, but correctly pointed out that electric power is not solely a california problem, it is a regional problem.  one member of the committee asked what the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting and construction process? keese referred to governor gray davis=01, executive order issued last week to which the cec plans to respond soon, date uncertain, that lays out a 6 month permitting time line.  the six months are enough if the applicant has the land secured, zoning okayed, transmission access, and air offsets.  hmmmmmm.  that alone might take six months before you get to the cec. the next panel included mr. kahn of the eob, and ms. lynch.  i went too sorry.  i promise to be nicer starting now.  the energy fuhrer instructed ms. lynch to use her authority to order sdg&e to divert the pass through of funds from the customers to the px until the dysfunction of the market is cured.  put it in an escrow account.  ms lynch promised to review this option at her august 21 puc meeting where she will enact the star of the day, i thought, was ferc general counsel doug smith. place of mr. hoecker, thank the lord.  mr. smith put into ferc-eese what these 12 legislators could not get through their heads any other way. the 12 angry legislators were looking for a way for ferc to declare the wholesale market as non-competitive, and then ask the generators to give back the money they over collected.  when can we do that?  mr. smith answered as only a ferc attorney can answer.  there is a process.  it takes time.  you must have evidence.  ferc uses a three-part criteria for assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable.  it=01,s based on market concentration and dominance, not the existence of high prices.  you would have to sue ferc in federal court, and the best you could hope for is for ferc to reconsider its decision upon remand from the us court of appeals. stumped.  herr (hair?) peace screamed, couldn=01,t you, mr. smith of ferc, today use your authority to declare the markets non-competitive, that generators who had market based rates have exercised market power, and retro-actively implement a $250 rate cap across the western region? like a wheezing accordion, mr. smith played back and forth the familiar strains of music, like a solo street musician on the corner.  back and forth: the process, the process, the process.  there have been times in the past i hated the process at ferc.  today, i have a renewed respect for what process affords me and you ... freedom from the tyranny of a mob. for the remainder of the hearing, they focused on remedies that could be undertaken by the puc.  @@@ puc issues oii on functioning of wholesale market well, the official title is, =01&order instituting

last business meeting of the commission, on august 3.  it calls for an investigation of the wholesale markets, responses from the three udcs, and a pre-hearing conference in san diego on august 29 at

""it was the first time the generators had an opportunity to see how high the  price could go,"" said ucan's michael shames. ""it was their primer. it was  state sen. steve peace, d-el cajon, who chaired a two-house committee that  completed the deregulation plan in 1996, had seen routine monitoring data  suggesting that the power market was being manipulated to drive up prices. peace took the unusual step last june of personally urging the adoption of a  much lower price cap by the board of the agency that makes last-minute power  purchases to maintain the grid, the independent system operator. but the motion failed by a single vote. the consumer representative who cast  the decisive vote against the lower cap resigned afterward with a blast at  peace, complaining of heavy-handed pressure. peace is unapologetic. he believes that stronger action by the iso last june  would have sent a signal that might have discouraged market manipulation. ""it's just like the federal reserve mis-timing an interest-rate move,"" peace  said. the former iso chairman, who represents generators, cited an iso report  attributing the price increase last may to the heat wave, power plant  outages, less hydroelectric power and higher prices for the natural gas used  by power plants. ""i think all of those things showing up at the same time resulted in  significantly higher prices,"" said jan smutny-jones of the independent energy  producers. why power prices remained at high levels and even soared last winter, instead  of dropping as usual, is more difficult to explain. the iso contended last month that generators overcharged by more than $6  billion from last may through february. but federal regulators, who have  their critics, have found only $125 million in overcharges, making it an  ""annus marvelous"" for generators. ed mendel is capitol bureau chief for the union-tribune.  copyright 2001 union-tribune publishing co.  the daily news of los angeles headline: proposed law puts bounty on energy manipulators byline: staff and wire services body: ??california stepped up its war on the power industry thursday as state legislators offered to pay millions of dollars to ""bounty hunters"" who provide information leading to the arrest and conviction of energy executives and  others who manipulate the electricity market. ???california ""is being plundered by an energy cartel,"" said lt. gov. cruz bustamente, who is promoting a bill that would level criminal penalties for exploiting energy markets. ?""if what they are doing isn't illegal, it ought to ???bustamente was one of a crowd of state leaders who went before microphones. ???on the floor of the assembly, speaker bob hertzberg, d-van nuys, rallied  his democratic colleagues behind a bill to create a state power authority with equally blistering attacks on private power suppliers. ???but after thursday's hearing before a senate committee formed to  investigate alleged price-fixing in the energy market, committee chairman joe dunn,  d-garden grove, told a reporter: ""i've never seen this much smoke when there wasn't a fire."" ???power generators insist they are operating fairly and say there is no evidence of them acting outside the law. ???jan smutny-jones, executive director of the independent energy producers association, dismissed the harsh rhetoric as unproductive.

wolak, an economics professor at stanford university, is, chairman of the market surveillance committee of the  california, independent system operator body: ??out-of-state firms selling into the california wholesale electricity market at exorbitant prices have been blamed for the current electricity crisis. they are, claim many observers, exercising their market power to raise wholesale electricity prices. ??although it is not illegal under california or u.s. antitrust law for a firm to exercise its market power, it is illegal to do so under the federal power act. the federal energy regulatory commission, or ferc, which regulates the california wholesale electricity market, is the entity charged with enforcing this law. its refusal to take sufficient actions that would result in ""just  and reasonable"" wholesale electricity rates is the fundamental cause of  california's current energy crisis. it is highly unlikely that anything it has done in the last week has changed things at all. power commission (the predecessor to ferc) to set ""just and reasonable"" wholesale electricity prices. just and reasonable prices are those that recover  production costs, including a ""fair"" rate of return on the capital invested by the firm. moreover, if the ferc finds that wholesale electricity prices are unjust and unreasonable, the federal power act gives it wide-ranging discretion to take actions that result in just and reasonable prices. the ferc can also order refunds for any payments by consumers in excess of just and reasonable prices. ??almost 10 years ago, the ferc began to allow generators to receive market prices instead of prices set through a cost-of-service regulatory process. however, there is no guarantee that market prices meet the just and reasonable standard required by the federal power act. markets often set prices substantially in excess of the production costs for significant periods of  time. this occurs because one or more firms operating in the market have what profit from it. ??however, if no firm possesses market power, the market price should be very close to a price that only recovers production costs. in such a circumstance, the price set by the market satisfies the just and reasonable standard of the federal power act. ??before it allows any market participant to receive a market price rather  than a cost-based price set through a regulatory process, the ferc requires each participant to demonstrate that it does not have market power. in other words, each market participant must submit sworn testimony to the ferc demonstrating  it does not have the ability to raise market prices and profit from this  behavior. ??each of the out-of-state generators made these filings before they began selling into the california market, which started in april 1998. each firm had its authority to receive market prices approved by the ferc for a three-year period that ends before this summer for several of the firms. it is virtually impossible to determine on a prospective basis whether a firm possesses market power. moreover, the methodology used by the ferc to make this determination uses analytical techniques that have long been acknowledged by the economics profession as grossly inadequate. the events of the past 10 months have demonstrated that contrary to their filings stating otherwise, all of the out-of-state generators possess significant market power. ??a number of independent studies have shown that the market power exercised  by these firms has resulted in unjust and unreasonable rates from may 2000, until market, the ferc concluded that wholesale electricity prices during the summer and autumn of 2000 were unjust and unreasonable and reflected the exercise of significant market power. ??despite its own conclusion, the ferc thus far has refused to set just and reasonable prices for wholesale electricity in california. instead, the ferc implemented market rule changes that have enhanced the ability of these firms  to set excessive wholesale electricity prices. in addition, it has refused to  order prices that it deemed unjust and unreasonable. ??fortunately for california consumers, the california public utilities commission and gov. gray davis refused to be accomplices in the ferc's  decision not to enforce the federal power act. they refused to pass on to california consumers prices that the ferc itself had determined were unjust and unreasonable. ??because these out-of-state firms must apply for renewal of their  market-based pricing authority before this summer, the ferc has one more opportunity to set just and reasonable prices for wholesale electricity in california. it has before it several proposals that would enforce all provisions of the federal power act. the health of the california and national economies would be  severely undermined if the ferc continues to ignore its legal obligations. headline: while a

subsidiary, national energy group, earned $162 million last year and ranked as the nation's third-largest power trader. compensation for the unit's  executives soared. many investors now believe that the subsidiary, just a decade in the making, is by itself worth more than its 96-year-old utility sibling. ???how did national energy get so big so fast? by using cash, partly generated by its sister utility, to buy unregulated power plants in the northeast,  expand trading-floor operations and sell power across the country. the exact numbers are in dispute, but much of nationals energy's profits last year came from california. ??most other large utilities have done the same thing over the past decade, building national or even global power companies from roots in local  monopolies. but nowhere is the success of these unregulated businesses more of an issue  than in california, where pg& e's investments may be challenged in bankruptcy  court. ??still, such transfers of assets were fundamental to deregulation plans in  two dozen states, and they were encouraged by federal rules designed to build a  new wholesale marketplace in electricity. ??and today, the offspring of the nation's utilities dominate that market, after industry leader enron. ?eight of the nation's 10 largest power marketers are affiliates or spinoffs of regulated utilities, controlling about 42  percent of power trading. ??it is largely these unregulated power producers and traders whose sales of power in california have prompted accusations by state leaders of price  gouging, and demands for the price caps that federal regulators took their first,  halting steps toward embracing last week. ??the profitability of the utilities' unregulated operations is becoming clear as companies report earnings for the first three months of the year. ??for example, reliant energy reported that operating income at its  unregulated percent more than at its regulated utility, which serves houston. this week, reliant expects to spin off its unregulated businesses through an initial  public stock offering that would put a market value on the new company of as much as ??a number of other major utility

san diego; the southern company in atlanta; the constellation energy group  in baltimore; and utilicorp united in kansas city, mo. ??in some places, the growth of the unregulated businesses continues to raise transfer plants to the new units at deep discounts to their market value. critics say that ratepayers, whose bills paid for the plants' construction, should benefit more when the plants are sold. ??in florida, a commission on energy deregulation formed by gov. jeb bush has proposed permitting such transfers on the grounds that they are needed to  create a new wholesale marketplace. opponents, including the florida municipal  electric association, which represents utilities owned by local governments, say the  plan would produce a $9 billion windfall that should go to ratepayers. ??in california, some creditors of pacific gas and electric have signaled that they will want the bankruptcy court in san francisco to review parent pg& e's efforts to keep its unregulated businesses out of creditors' reach. ??and the california public utilities commission is investigating whether pg&  e and edison international, whose southern california edison utility unit is  also near insolvency, have improperly transferred cash to their parents and to unregulated sister companies. ??a recent audit ordered by the commission showed that pacific gas and  electric dividends and stock

their plans. ??the most consistent fighters for public power during the decades after the straw poll were the central labor council, international brotherhood of electrical workers, other unions and city employees who stuffed campaign envelopes, canvassed precincts and got out the vote. voters who favored municipally owned power and initiatives bolstering the dwp tended to be  working class and democratic; those opposed were mainly middle and upper class and republican. ??in this polarized political climate, mayor alexander called for a $ 6.5-million bond issue to complete the aqueduct-power distribution network; he left open the question of who would sell the power to consumers. unions and socialists tied their support for the bonds to a city charter reform that  would guarantee them a long-sought role in city government through proportional representation. when the reform failed at the polls, they withheld support  from rancor workers felt was aimed at progressives like lissner, head of the good  government organization, who fought labor's charter plank because it would bring  socialists onto the city council. ??the labor movement's dedication to public ownership soon reasserted itself, however. with a citywide election coming up that june, five unionists seeking council seats on the socialist party ticket revived labor's long-standing  demand for city operation of all public utilities at cost. they urged the city  council to hold a new power-bond election with a clear public ownership mandate. they attacked the power companies' efforts to buy aqueduct power from the city and sell it to angelenos at a profit. soon, the great majority of unions in the central labor council were locked in what turned out to be a decisive struggle against the power oligopoly made up of southern california edison, pacific  light ??an unprecedented event brightened the bonds' chances. a machinist, fred c. wheeler, won a seat on the city council, the first unionist to do so in the  century. wheeler led a successful fight against an attempt to split the power-bond issue into two separate ballot propositions, one to complete the aqueduct's generating stations, the other to create a city-owned distribution system. such a division would probably have doomed public power. ??the large majority of unionists who favored public power had little time to savor wheeler's victory. while pressing the attack on the three electric companies, they faced a small but angry split in their own ranks. dissenters  in the building trades council and a few of its unions argued that labor's grievances against the progressive regimes of 1909-14 had turned the argument for municipal ownership on its head. what good was municipal ownership in the hands of a council and mayor who had caused the arrest of hundreds of peaceful picketers during the citywide strikes of 1910, had underpaid aqueduct workers and fed them bad food and had denied unionists influential city jobs? the  final blow was the council's rebuff of a petition signed by thousands of workers  for a ""living wage"" law. was it not folly to reward labor's foes with control of the aqueduct's power? ??union activists who favored the bonds conceded that the dissenters were correct in their assessment of ""progressive"" city government. but the progressive star was fading. what counted in the long run was whether los angeles could wrest the city's electric power system from the grasp of private utilities. the central labor council's unions took this challenge to heart and voted, 60-4, for a resolution favoring the bonds. ??on its own, as well as in coalition with other groups, the labor movement marshaled its rank and file on behalf of public power. it turned out hundreds  of poll-watchers and canvassers on election day. the pro-bond unions never did  win over the dissenting faction; rather, they overwhelmed it at the polls. on may  with the city's working-class wards providing by far the largest margin of victory. ??within a year, los angeles sold its bonds and began buying out the three investor-owned utilities. the first public power flowed into local homes and businesses in 1916. two decades later, the dwp eliminated the last of its private competition and consolidated the working-class legacy of kilowatt and water socialism that has served the city so well in the current energy crisis.

forecast how bad it can get, either the blackouts or the financial consequences. but as may approaches, it's certain that most californians are  not adequately informed about the severity of the problem or what they can do to limit its impact. ??gov. gray davis, the utilities and others need to engage in a crash  education program that will convince californians of the seriousness of the

an economist i respect, chiding me for my ""naderite"" columns on the california energy crisis. he just didn't believe  that market manipulation by power companies could possibly be an important issue;  it sounded too much to him like the sort of thing one hears from knee-jerk leftists, who blame greedy capitalists for every problem, be it third-world poverty or high apartment rents. the left has cried ""wolf!"" so many times that sensible people have learned to discount such claims. ??but now a bona fide wolf has arrived, whose predatory behavior is doing ???true, california would be heading for a summer of power shortages even if  it had never deregulated. and even if there was workable competition in the wholesale electricity market, prices in that market would spike during periods of peak demand, transferring billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the generators. ??but the evidence is now overwhelming that there isn't workable competition  in california's power market, and that the actions of generators ""gaming the system"" have greatly magnified the crisis. the key fact is that california has somehow remained in a state of more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale prices regardless of the level of demand. a rash of outages has supply even during periods of low demand, when there ought to be lots of  excess capacity. ??as frank wolak, the stanford economist who also advises the state's power grid, has pointed out, an outage at a power plant is a lot like an employee calling in sick. you can't tell directly whether he is really sick or has  chosen to take the day off for other reasons, but you can look for circumstantial evidence. and such evidence has convinced mr. wolak that ""generators use  forced by a growing number of other researchers. ??which brings us to the latest move by the federal energy regulatory commission. on wednesday, the commission apparently decided to offer  california some relief, and put new price caps in place on the california electricity  market. i say ""apparently"" because the more you look at the plan the less  likely vote, ineffectual. ??what's wrong with ferc's plan? first, it caps prices only in emergency hard-to-explain levels even when there is no emergency. in effect, the plan is laid out as if the electricity market were really competitive, in spite of all the evidence that it is not. ??second, even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes, offering selling power to affiliated companies that for one reason or another are exempted from the price controls (for example, the controls do not apply to ""imports"" from neighboring states), then selling it back into the california market. severin borenstein of the university of california energy institute  adds that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at the least efficient plant, generators will have a clear incentive to produce inefficiently: ""i predict we will find some plants we never heard of before  that are suddenly operating again, and they will be pretty inefficient."" ??the general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan. there are has ignored all of them. ??the charitable interpretation is that ferc still doesn't get it, that it  just can't bring itself to believe that this time the wolf is real. the  uncharitable interpretation is that last week's action was meant to fail. the medley  report, an online newsletter, calls the ferc plan ""a grand exercise in posturing  without substance . . . a very clever temporary move by the bush administration to deflect any political fallout"" from the looming disaster. ??whatever the explanation, the plain fact is that ferc and the administration have yet to offer california any significant relief. ??http://www.nytimes.com headline: diesel plants spark concern they're expected to generate big air-quality problems when predicted summer blackouts hit. byline: chris bowman and stuart leavenworth bee staff writers body: ??when blackouts roll across california in the coming months - as captains of the crippled electricity grid say they surely will - tens of thousands of miniature powerhouses will whine, cough and rumble to the rescue. ??these backup plants will ignite the same fuel that powers locomotives, ships because most are old, with little or no emissions controls. ??they are diesel-powered generators, the dirtiest of internal combustion engines. and unlike trucks and other vehicles, they've largely escaped 30  years of air pollution restrictions because they were intended only for emergencies, as when a storm or earthquake knocks out power. ??but, now, as a season of multiple planned blackouts appears imminent, many california businesses are expected to fire up the old stogies more often than was ever imagined. ??and the generators will kick in when their expelled gases can do the most harm. the hot weather that taxes air conditioners and drains electricity  supplies also accelerates the conversion of engine exhaust to ozone gas, the ingredient in smog that inflames airways and impairs breathing. ??""that is why we think this is going to be the most challenging summer ever for air quality,"" said luna salaver, spokeswoman for the bay area air quality management district, a nine-county region with thousands of unregulated  standby generators. ??""on those hot days when we want people to stop driving and doing things that pollute the air, the generators will kick in, and air quality will worsen,"" salaver said. ??no one knows how many diesel generators are scattered around the state at hospitals, universities, factories and businesses. but air districts report the san joaquin valley; and thousands more in the smog-plagued valleys of southern california. ??some are relatively clean, particularly if they have been built or retrofitted in the last few years. but most are tiny pollution factories, and were intended only to be run for short periods following natural disasters. ??according to the state air resources board, a typical diesel generator emits typical gas-fired power plant. when the plants run for hours, people downwind can get a heavy dose of the tiny, toxic particles contained in diesel exhaust. ??""go down to the greyhound bus station and have them turn on their engines  and hang around there - that's what it's like,"" said michael scheible, deputy executive officer of the state air resources board, which regulates engines  and fuels. ??environmentalists say generators should be cranked up only during power outages. but in recent months, farmers and manufacturers have pressured regulators to redefine an emergency and allow generators to be used well  before a blackout is ordered. ??business groups say regulators need to be sensitive to data centers, chip makers and other manufacturers that can't afford even a one-second  interruption in power. the diesel generators,"" said gino dicaro, a spokesman for the california manufacturers and technology association. ""obviously, we would like to use  them more than we can now."" ??""we need to basically let go of this air-quality issue,"" said mike jennings, a fresno energy consultant whose clients include members of the  food-processing and dairy industries. ??state air and energy regulators are pushing energy conservation as the best way to avoid power outages. nonetheless, the california energy commission has been compiling a list of generators statewide to see how their use could be coordinated, a move that stirs hope from business groups. ??""six months ago, nobody wanted to talk about this because diesel was a big, bad word,"" dicaro said. ""now, at least we have agencies like the energy commission and the public utilities commission talking about how diesel generators can fit into our electrically unreliable world."" ??environmentalists worry that, as the summer drags on, gov. gray davis will allow unrestricted use of the diesels. ??so far, the governor's staff has ""held firm,"" said gail ruderman feuer, an attorney with the natural resources defense council, a national environmental group. ""but if blackouts start happening in a big way, they could change their tune."" ??along with other forecasters, officials with the california independent system operator, manager of the state's electricity grid, expect a flurry of blackouts in coming months. the next two months could be critical, because  most new power plants under construction won't go on line before july. in addition, california will be losing one of its largest generators of electricity today when one of two units at the diablo canyon nuclear power plant is taken  off-line for 35 days of scheduled refueling. ??""you should be ready for the worst-case scenario,"" said del evans, pacific gas and electric co.'s head of power load management, at a media briefing last week. ??for sellers and makers of diesel generators, the gloomy predictions are a gold mine. small businesses, farmers, manufacturers - all are rushing to buy generators before the blackouts hit. ??""we are busier than we have ever been,"" said rob bly, president of tuban industrial products co., which assembles about 300 generators a year at its madness."" decade ago. still, he acknowledges, diesel is diesel. the fire marshall won't let you,"" said bly. ""that leaves you with just one thing, and that is diesel."" ??responding to such concerns, state sen. rico oller, r-andreas, introduced a bill this year to exempt thousands of backup generators from pollution  controls whenever any power alert is called. the bill, however, was blocked by a senate committee, and environmentalists say air districts have already relaxed their rules enough. ??""one of the big concerns is the cancer risk,"" ruderman feuer said. air board studies, she noted, have found that a person's lifetime cancer risk increases  year. ??in january, the u.s. environmental protection agency allowed air districts  to loosen their restrictions on generators. in turn, the south coast air quality management district extended the number of hours that diesel generators could  be operated each year. the san joaquin valley air pollution control district went even further, allowing businesses to run generators when state power reserves drop to 1.5 percent or when the iso predicts blackouts anywhere in the valley. ??the sacramento metropolitan air quality management district still requires businesses and public agencies to wait for blackouts before generators are  fired up. altogether, the district has permits for 641 generators, including major clusters at data centers and companies such as intel. ??in the bay area, regulators are even more uncertain of what could happen  this summer. unlike other regions of the state, the bay area never required permits for diesel generators smaller than 250 horsepower. (in sacramento, the  threshold to pollution controls. ??salaver, the district's spokeswoman, said officials assumed the generators would be used only during earthquakes, and therefore didn't need any  regulation. ??""now, we find people are operating generators even if we are in a stage two alert,"" salaver said.

""the discussions and negotiations broke down because they would not agree to the basic principles that were reached by (pg&e chairman) bob glynn and michael peevey,"" low said. ??pg&e also became disgusted with a series of puc rulings in late march and early april that it believed would seriously hinder its ability to recover its debts. ??things came to a head april 5 when davis proposed a rate increase and outlined his rescue plan in a televised address. a few minutes later, joseph fichera, a wall street financier advising davis, and other davis advisers  held a conference call in which they fleshed out the details for investors. edison officials and directors listened in, but pg&e didn't, fichera said. ??""they had made up their minds,"" fichera said, referring to pg&e officials. ??the next morning, with glynn dismissing davis' speech as ""a lot of words,"" the utility filed for bankruptcy protection. ??that afternoon, davis called pg&e ""selfish"" and pointedly went into a negotiating session with john bryson, the chairman and chief executive of edison's parent edison international. ??for davis, the meeting was crucial. although edison had tentatively agreed  in february to sell its transmission lines, the deal wasn't sewn up and davis was nervous the pg&e bankruptcy would prompt edison's creditors to ""jerk edison  into bankruptcy,"" davis said last week. ??that afternoon, ""conceptually we reached an agreement,"" davis said. the deal was announced the following monday. ??consumer advocates and some legislative leaders blasted the agreement as a giveaway, and said davis hastily sweetened the terms for edison because he needed to show progress on the energy crisis in the wake of the pg&e  imbroglio. ??not true, davis said; the basic terms were already on the table before pg&e filed for bankruptcy. either way, edison was receptive to negotiating with davis. natural gas business, it doesn't have the track record pg&e does with free markets. it is more comfortable in the regulatory and political realm, experts say. jerry brown's chief of staff. level of comfort in dealing with a very adversarial process. he felt he could rely on the governor."" ??politically savvy, edison is one of the utility industry's biggest contributors to national political campaigns, and it usually spends more than pg&e on california campaigns. edison international's board of directors  includes los angeles attorney warren christopher, the former u.s. secretary of state  and an elder statesman of the democratic party. ??though it's open to negotiations, edison isn't a pussycat. to the contrary, experts say. willoughby, a retired pg&e lobbyist. confrontational, aggressive company and edison as the get-along, let's-work-with-the-regulators company."" ??edison hasn't been shy about going to sacramento for favors; last year, for example, edison wanted some changes made in the operation of the state's power grid. instead of talking to the grid manager, the independent system operator, edison went to the legislature, a source said. lawmakers then pressured the  iso to make the changes. ??one more factor may have played into edison's willingness to deal with the governor. ??last year it became involved in a protracted dispute with the federal energy regulatory commission, which oversees the transmission grid, over how much profit edison could earn from the grid. ??edison eventually won its point, but the case influenced the utility's thinking when davis offered to buy the grid. according to industry consultant barbara barkovich, edison figured, why wrestle with the federal government  over profits when it simply could raise billions through a cash sale? ??besides, edison has a back-up plan if the legislature scraps the grid purchase, as many lawmakers have threatened. the company has said it would follow pg&e's lead and file for bankruptcy. ??but its willingness to negotiate with the governor will have served it well, even if it goes into bankruptcy, said nancy day, a utility industry veteran consulting for the legislature. ??day said she believes the governor's appointees on the puc will ""punish""  for its behavior. if edison winds up in bankruptcy court, it ""won't be  punished for it,"" day said. ??puc president loretta lynch couldn't be reached for comment. ??energy

that  has so far defied politicians' simplistic - perhaps simple-minded - efforts at resolution. ??that said, one may speculate reasonably on the financial, social and political consequences for california in the months and years ahead. ??financially, californians - especially the 70 percent who are served by private electric utilities - will feel the pinch for years, if not decades, to come. before the crisis hit, california's power rates were already among the highest in the nation. given the nearly $20 billion in power purchase debts  that the utilities and the state have accumulated so far, the stubbornly high wholesale prices and other data, it's not unreasonable to project that californians in private utility areas will see their rates double, or rise  even higher. ??politicians have been laying the rhetorical groundwork for big increases, although they've been disingenuous about the outer parameters. the burden will fall most heavily on business customers and, coupled with doubts about power reliability and rising natural gas prices, will damage the state's ability to attract job-creating investment. states with low and stable energy prices already are using the crisis as a recruiting tool. in february, intel  president craig barrett told the wall street journal: ""as long as california is a third world country, we won't build $2 billion manufacturing plants here."" ??the inevitable escalation of utility rates will create distortions within  the state as well, since utility rates for the 30 percent of californians served  by publicly owned utilities are not likely to rise by more than token amounts.  the municipal utilities' rates were roughly a third lower than private utilities' rates prior to the crisis. by the time the dust settles, they may be just half as much. it will contribute to the balkanization of california that was  already being defined by such factors as housing prices, ethnicity and income levels. low-cost regions will become magnets for people and jobs while high-price regions will be shunned. elections, and perhaps for others to follow. gov. gray davis' popularity has plummeted since he took charge of the crisis, laying waste to his intentions to seek an easy re-election next year as a middle-of-the-road, business-friendly, tough-on-crime education reformer. ??with his popularity waning, davis may be compelled to turn left, shoring up his base by catering to demands of labor unions, environmentalists, trial lawyers and other liberal elements of the democratic party. that, in turn,  would undermine the triangulating strategy he has pursued, in which he took  democratic voters for granted and cultivated business executives and social  conservatives. business interests are worried, for example, that davis may now feel compelled to sign union-friendly legislation, such as boosts in workers' compensation  and unemployment benefits, that he vetoed in the past. ??davis' relations with fellow democrats in the legislature have turned from cool to poisonous, with lawmakers openly trashing his leadership and  management of the energy crisis and worrying that he'll try to shift the blame to them if the crisis turns to disaster. if democratic leaders fear that voters will be  in a throw-the-bums-out mood next year, they may throttle back on intentions to maximize their party strength in drawing new legislative districts. such maximization would require spreading democratic voters out among many  districts, and such margin-thinning could make democrats vulnerable in an energy crisis-spawned voter rebellion. democrats may well strive for fewer but safer seats. ??these are but a few of the potential effects that california will experience long after the immediate crisis has faded, whenever that may be. . headline: the energy crisis is good for you source: insight senior writer byline: louis freedberg body: here's a message for pampered and overindulged citizens of the golden state  who

the discipline that eludes us. except for the hardships the crisis has inflicted on the poor, californians still enjoy a sybaritic lifestyle that, in ways, would put to shame the pharaohs of egypt or

"please see the following articles: bakersfield californian, wed 3/7: ""el paso energy closes six valley power  plants"" if utility orders summer blackouts"" pg&e, edison want to trim costs by laying off thousands, cutting service"" east county residents blast supervisors"" contra costa times wed 3/7: ""supervisors set search for power plant sites"" generator could be sending  breakthrough made in rescue of pg&e  by steve geissinger sacramento bureau  davis administration disclosed tuesday it may announce the framework of a  pact to rescue the teetering pacific gas and electric co. next week.  ""things are going very well,"" said steve maviglio, a spokesman for gov. gray  davis.  to financially renovate the north-state utility, according to sources  familiar with the negotiations.  but consumer advocates insisted that even the $7 billion price is too much to  pay. and experts warned that a deal with pg&e will be more complex than with  other utilities.  pg&e representatives declined comment, in keeping with their policy on the  talks, even though the davis administration said an announcement could come  as early as next week or the following week. the new timetable for an  announcement was substantially sooner than in davis' original forecast.  until late last week, pg&e was still resisting the sale of its power grid  despite the fact that davis had announced the framework of an agreement with  southern california edison. davis expects to soon announce a similar deal  with the san diego gas and electric co. however, any such deal still would  need federal approval.  the investor-owned utilities, trapped between high wholesale costs and lower,  regulated retail rates, amassed nearly $13 billion in debts and were unable  to buy electricity this winter. with the onset of rolling blackouts, the  state began brokering billions of dollars in emergency short- and long-term  power purchases.  davis' strategy to ease the energy price and supply crisis includes  bolstering both conservation and generation while fiscally refurbishing the  nearly bankrupt utilities.  as part of the rescue deal, the utilities would have to drop legal actions  seeking dramatically higher electricity bills, environmentally shield  wildlands they own, sell power from their generators to californians for the  next decade and secure help with their debts from their parent companies.  power grids, the utilities would be allowed to sell bonds to raise funds and  use customer money to pay them off.  the state would upgrade the high-voltage lines and lease them back to the  utilities for operation. in a reflection of the negotiations with the three  utilities, a davis administration official said the deal with pg&e is proving  to be more complex than with the other firms.  though pg&e finally agreed late last week to sell its transmission grid, the  utility apparently wants more than the $7 billion that davis has offered,  according to sources.  the figure is more than twice the book amount, or the value placed on the  system for purposes of accounting. and that's the markup that lured edison  into an agreement to sell its smaller portion of the transmission grid for  but pg&e, which fears an erosion of its economic base, may be asking as much  industry, pg&e is more likely to lose revenue than edison as a result of  selling its transmission lines, according to experts.  big customers might be able to bypass the utility's remaining local  distribution lines, thereby eroding its customer base.  therefore the utility may view bankruptcy, and sale of its transmission lines  to the highest bidder, as a potentially attractive alternative to selling its  share of the grid to the state at too low a price. el paso energy closes six valley power plants by chip power, californian staff writer e-mail:   el paso energy, citing non-payment from pacific gas & electric co., said it  has shut down six cogeneration plants this week.  the smaller plants produced about 175 megawatts of electricity and are  located primarily in the san joaquin valley, said company spokesman mel  non-payment, according to the state independent system operator, which  manages most of the state's electrical distribution.  the el paso energy plants are operated with various partners and had not been  compensated for december, january and february deliveries, said scott. he  said he did not know the total amount due but said the plants would be closed  until pg&e's credit worthiness is improved.  a cogeneration plant, common in oil fields, simultaneously produces heat  energy and electrical or mechanical power from the same fuel in the same  facility. typically, it produces electricity and steam, which can be deployed  to enhance oil recovery.  kern county is the state's leading oil-producing county.  intrastate pipeline connecting the nation's principal natural gas supply  regions to the five largest consuming regions in the

state department of water resources for the customers of two  nearly bankrupt utilities.  pacific gas and electric co., southern california edison and the state  disagree over how the dwr eventually will be reimbursed for its purchases on  the expensive last-minute power market. so do the state power regulators, who  have the final call over who gets the money when.  under a recent law, the dwr went into the electricity-buying business to help  keep the two utilities from sinking further into their $13 billion debt. the  state plans to retrieve the money by selling $10 billion in revenue bonds.  the utilities continue to collect ratepayer dollars on that electricity,  which the bill's author, assemblyman fred keeley, d-boulder creek, says is  meant to help them begin paying down their debt.  in a recent letter, however, dwr officials requested that the state public  utilities commission order that a portion of that money be diverted to the  state.  but after the utilities subtract the costs of generating electricity,  payments to environmentally friendly power plants and other expenses, there  is no money left from ratepayer dollars to give to the dwr without sinking  further into debt, pg&e spokesman ron low said tuesday.  if it passed along money to the dwr, ""our undercollection would grow by about  the commission, unable to agree on the best course of action, left the issue  untouched at its last meeting but expects to revisit the issue when it meets  this morning. commissioner richard bilas is proposing an alternate plan that  would have the dwr set its own revenue requirements that would be passed on  to ratepayers.  the puc also is expected to respond to complaints from laid-off workers and  customers that layoffs by utilities to cut costs have been hurting service.  commissioner carl wood warned at the last meeting that failure to provide  safe and reliable service could mean fines for the utilities.  representatives from electrical workers unions, the puc and the utilities  were to discuss the issue tuesday afternoon.  ""i don't think we believe that utilities can find a way out of their problems  by laying off workers,"" said mindy spatt, a spokeswoman with the utility  reform network. ""we think consumers deserve safe and reliable service, and we  think they deserve it at a reasonable price."" state taxpayers in dark on details of energy deal  david lazarus, chronicle staff writer few people would purchase a car simply because the dealer said, ''trust me,  it's a great deal.'' yet gov. gray davis essentially is telling californians  just that about dozens of long-term power contracts.  because of confidentiality agreements with power companies, the governor has  revealed only scant details about the state's multibillion-dollar contracts  for electricity over the next 10 years.  heller, a spokesman for the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights in  neither davis nor power companies would divulge specific details about the  price, duration or scope of individual contracts. each cited secrecy clauses  that the governor's office said had been desired by both sides.  what consumers do know is this:  decade.  market went haywire last summer.  state nevertheless will be locked into paying above-market rates for  electricity.  but it is not known which generator agreed to part with the most power at the  cheapest level or the full range of the prices in concocting the $69 average.  moreover, it is unclear how shrewdly the state negotiated with taxpayer money  in securing power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities.  ""these agreements are the bedrock of our long-term energy policy,"" davis said  monday in announcing the deals.  the governor's office defended the murky nature of the contracts yesterday.  ""it's a business transaction in which private corporate information is  included,"" said steve maviglio, a spokesman for davis. ""that's the kind of  information that never gets revealed.""  while additional elements of the contracts will be publicized in coming  months, he said, the contracts themselves will remain a secret.  ""you'll never see all the details,"" maviglio said.  this did not sit well with many observers.  ""it's a breach of public trust,"" said daniel bacon, a san francisco attorney  specializing in business law. ""a public servant spending public money  shouldn't be able to keep the spending secret.""  but gary ackerman, executive director of the western power trading forum, an  energy-industry association in menlo park, called confidentiality agreements  ""a necessary evil in transactions like this.""  he explained that no power company would agree to a long-term contract if  rival firms could learn the terms of the accord. the company would be losing  too much of its competitive edge in the marketplace, ackerman said.  sellers.  a high price with one generator would not necessarily be sought by all power  providers.  still, the fact that public funds are being used makes confidentiality in  this case a different matter than, say, cisco systems' quietly negotiating to  take over yet another tech rival.  ""the public is in a very awkward position,"" said michael shames, executive  director of the utility consumers' action network in san diego. ""it has to  rely on the good word and expertise of the governor, and he has yet to  demonstrate that he has expertise or good word in this field.""  shames likened consumers to passengers in a plane being flown by a pilot  without a license to fly.  available right now.""  there's the rub. no matter how bad a deal california may have cut to help  on the other hand, it already appears that the new contracts will not shield  californians from the threat of daily outages this summer, when demand  surges. davis said only about 60 percent of the state's summertime  electricity needs so far had been met.  part of the reason is that many power companies already have contracted for  their output this year.  duke energy said this was why it would not begin its nine-year contract with  california until 2002, while williams cos. said it would only gradually  increase the amount of available wattage in its 10-year contract.  both companies, meanwhile, will continue to profit this summer by selling  into the volatile ""spot"" market, where wholesale power went for as much as  ""you can't sell all your power into long-term contracts,"" said paula hall-  collins, a williams spokeswoman. ""you save some for the spot market.""  consumer groups worry that consumers will be hammered again this summer with  sky-high power prices, and then get nailed down the road by contracts for  above-market rates.  being gouged for 10 years,"" said heller of the foundation for taxpayer and  consumer rights.

""people will die in california because of this crisis,"" rep. brad sherman, a  los angeles-area republican, warned the house energy and commerce committee.  sherman testified that his idea for saving lives is to extend daylight-saving  time by an extra hour, so that there would be more daylight at the end of the  day when power consumption surges.  ""one of the peak demand periods for electricity occurs between 5 p.m. and 8  p.m., when the sun sets and people come home from work,"" sherman testified.  ""if people come home and it is light out, there is less of an inclination to  sherman said the state legislature has called for congressional approval for  states to be given authority to extend daylight-saving time, and he cited  analyses by the california energy commission and other agencies suggesting  that it could cut power consumption by 1 percent to 2 percent.  sherman, who was one of about a dozen california lawmakers presenting their  views on the energy squeeze, drew no questions from committee leaders about  what his legislation might do to everything from airline schedules to  television programming if west coast states didn't agree on the same time  standard.  most of the committee's questioning was on the more popular idea proposed by  several california and western lawmakers, primarily democrats, to require the  federal energy regulatory commission to impose caps on wholesale electricity  prices that have gone wild because of a regional power shortage.  rep. bob filner, d-san diego, charged that the price spiral has little to do  with power shortages but a lot to do with a ""small cartel"" of generators  bilking ratepayers.  rep. jay inslee, d-wash., said he brought up the idea of regional price caps  with president bush, who was initially skeptical. but inslee said that bush  warmed to the idea after being told that protections could be built into the  caps so as not to discourage construction of new power plants.  upon hearing that, inslee said, bush invited him to meet with the president's  cabinet-level task force led by vice president dick cheney on a national  energy strategy. but inslee said he can't get the group to meet with him.  ""it's very disappointing,"" inslee said.  tuesday's hearing was part of a series the panel is holding on the california  crisis, so far without any emerging consensus on what, if anything, congress  should do. power plan called wrong  wall street analysts say the governor's approach to the problem avoids the  issue that caused the imbalance.  by don thompson the associated press  sacramento california's scramble to insulate consumers from the soaring price  of electricity may add to the state's power problems this summer, wall street  analysts said tuesday.  gov. gray davis' emphasis on buying utilities' transmission lines and  negotiating long-term power contracts to help ease their debts skirts the  deep imbalance between wholesale and market rates that led to the state's  power problems in the first place, they said.  ""in the long run, it doesn't solve anything,"" said michael worms, an industry  analyst for gerard klauer mattison & co. ""in the long run, you need to send  the right price signals to consumers, which will create its own conservation  signals. unfortunately, customers were shielded from that in california.""  davis said monday that the state's first contracts to buy electricity for two  financially struggling utilities will provide only about two-thirds of the  power needed on a typical summer day, forcing californians to cut power use  at least 10 percent to avoid blackouts.  since early january, the state has been buying one- third of the power  southern california edison and pacific gas and electric co. customers need.  the two utilities, denied credit by suppliers, say they have lost nearly $14  billion due to soaring wholesale electricity prices that the state's  industry-deregulation law says they cannot pass on to consumers.  the keepers of the state power grid had enough electricity tuesday to avoid  declaring an electricity alert, but have faced an almost-daily scramble for  weeks due to a tight supply and high wholesale prices.  several wholesale and retail rate proposals are circulating. among them:  free-market advocates such as worms want an immediate end to the  deregulation-imposed retail rate freeze on edison and pg&e that will expire  next year.  he says have been prof iteering from california's short energy supply. the  bush administration and federal energy regulatory commission are cool to that  idea.  rates in the state and required suppliers to justify any higher prices they  charge.  consumer groups such as the utility reform network, or turn, want regulated  rates for residential and small-business customers, but free-market rates for  large industrial customers, which sought deregulation in the first place.  turn also advocates a tiered rate structure, with higher rates for consumers  who use more than a reasonable amount of electricity each month.  assembly republicans say electricity and natural-gas prices will fall  naturally if the state increases supply, mainly by making it easier to build  plants and pipelines.  ""right now, you're sort of sitting partially with regulation and part with  the free market,"" said paul fremont, an analyst with jefferies & co. ""both  these systems work. it's sort of that in-between system that you have in  califor nia that doesn't appear to be working.""  the system discourages generators from building new power plants because they  aren't guaranteed a profit, and it doesn't do enough to discourage power use  by consumers because the price they pay doesn't reflect the true cost of  power, fremont said.  ""i don't think people here have much faith in the market, and why should  they?"" countered turn's mindy spatt. ""i think there are probably better ways  of encouraging consumers to conserve than by gouging them.""  davis insists the crisis can be resolved without raising rates for edison and  pg&e customers beyond ""the existing rate structure.""  in january, state regulators imposed temporary rate hikes of 7 to 15 percent  on edison and pg&e customers.  the legislature and davis extended the increases for up to a decade to help  pay back the estimated $10 billion in power buying the state expects to do  for edison and pg&e over the next several years, and finance its purchase of  the power lines owned by the two companies and san diego gas & electric.  rates were already scheduled to increase next year for edison and pg&e  that rate cut will likely expire as planned, davis spokesman steve maviglio  has said.  davis wants those rates to cover not only the traditional cost of generating,  transporting and distributing power, but the added cost of paying off the two  utilities' massive debt and buying their transmission lines, said assemblyman  fred keeley, d-boulder creek, the assembly's chief power negotiator.  yet davis has indirectly addressed the rate imbalance by signing legislation  that will let regulators raise consumer rates if necessary, keeley said.  the governor and lawmakers are in effect spreading out rate increases over a  decade by using long-term revenue bonds to buy power for the nearly bankrupt  utilities, said severin borenstein, director of the university of california  energy institute.  or it's going to come from ratepayers,"" bor enstein said. ""raising rates now  would get us a lot of conservation.""  davis also wants financial incentives for conservation and power-plant  construction in time to make a difference this summer.

""it is illegal, it is unethical and it's  alternative energy producers are in his district.       as democrats on the senate energy committee blocked the bill, battin  warned that some alternative energy producers might react to the delay by  trying to force southern california edison and pacific gas & electric into  bankruptcy.  committee chairwoman debra bowen (d-marina del rey) to retort: ""i'm really  tired of being threatened with bankruptcy.""       alternative energy producers, including those that use wind, solar  power, biomass and other means, produce 27% of the energy used in california.  they sell the electricity to the utilities, which in turn transmit it to  retail consumers. but with the utilities facing multibillion-dollar debts,  the alternative energy producers under contract with edison have not been  paid since november.       scores of alternative energy producers supported the measure. edison  international and the san francisco-based consumer group, the utility reform  network, opposed it. michael florio of the utility reform group said the deal  could result in higher consumer prices; an edison representative said the  same thing.  arrangement with many of the generators. keeley took the lead in the early  negotiations, and then turned to battin to introduce the legislation, sb 47x.       rather convoluted language would have allowed higher payments to a  select few generators that produce electricity from wind and biomass.       most of california's wind suppliers, for instance, would have received  about 6 cents per kilowatt-hour. but a handful of them, about half a dozen       battin contends that other wind producers receive additional payments  that boost them to the same level as windtec and others that would get the  higher payments.  would benefit from the provisions he added to the bill.       in california's overall energy market, the amount of money that would  have flowed to the favored generators is minor. but the added prices that  would have been paid to the generators would have translated to at least $19  million in the next five years, to be absorbed by southern california edison  customers, according to one analysis.       also tuesday, more details were disclosed about another leg of the  generators to supply electricity to california for as long as 10 years.  bedrock"" of california's energy policy. but some consumer advocates warned  that the deals could lock the state into excessively high-priced contracts.       s. david freeman, the general manager of the los angeles department of  water and power and davis' negotiator, said that the state guarded against  expected to be available this summer, about one-third of the energy needed by  the state, freeman said. the amount of power under contract swells until more  contracts, which may turn out to be somewhat higher or somewhat lower than  the spot market,"" and purchases on the spot market. pg&e could face mutiny on outages: smud, others may balk if utility orders  summer blackouts  by carrie peyton bee staff writer sacramento's electric utility wants out of a deal that imposes rolling  blackouts locally on pg&e's command.  so do a lot of other utilities.  they've been writing letters, lobbying lawmakers and launching informal talks  with pacific gas and electric co. to get off the hook before summer.  who dodges the blackout bullet ""is going to play out as a political hot  button"" around the state, said george fraser, head of the northern california  power agency, a coalition of municipal utilities.  in sacramento, the next volley is expected soon, with the sacramento  municipal utility district reportedly poised to notify pg&e that it will no  longer black out homes and businesses on the larger utility's command.

""the contracts are being inspected with a fine-tooth comb,"" said smud  director howard posner.  schori declined to comment on any specifics. sources indicated that the main  option being considered is notifying pg&e that because of changed  circumstances, smud believes it no longer is required to routinely comply  with outage requests.  other options being explored include re-negotiating existing agreements with  posner said that ever since two days of rolling blackouts in january,  constituents have been asking him, "" 'why are we participating when we're not  electricity under contract to meet its customers' summer demands. they  believe pg&e should do the same.  ""we're almost like a david against goliath here,"" said board vice president  genevieve shiroma. ""the huge investor-owned utilities next door have severe  problems that they need to get under control.""  in addition, smud plans to argue that because it can cut usage through its  ""peak corps"" program, which remotely turns off air conditioners at volunteer  households, it has already done its part without rotating outages, director  davis said.  pg&e believes the interconnection agreements that govern smaller utilities'  ties to its transmission lines have ""benefits and burdens to both sides,""  said nelson.  ""it wouldn't be fair or good policy for just one provision to be altered  without taking a look at how that affects the entire contract,"" he said.  interconnection contracts generally have clauses that require utilities to  help each other out to avert greater emergencies.  stabilize the electric grid in the seconds after a major power plant or  transmission line fails.  ""it's been around in the electrical fabric forever,"" said jim pope, head of  silicon valley power, santa clara's city-run utility. in addition to legal  requirements, ""you have a moral obligation so you don't bring the system to  collapse.""  like other city-run utilities, silicon valley power has a contract with pg&e  that requires it to shed load during an electric emergency. but its contract  allows it to work with big users to reduce their demand, so no one has to be  completely shut off.  such agreements, formed long before deregulation when pg&e ran the north  independent system operator. the iso today runs pieces of the grid owned by  if it believes power use is about to surge past supply, potentially  triggering a grid collapse across the western united states, the iso notifies  the three utilities that they have to shed a certain number of megawatts.  the big utilities meet that requirement two ways. they cut circuits to some  of their own customers, and they tell smaller, connected utilities to cut a  proportionate share.  in northern california, about 80 percent of the outages are borne by pg&e  customers and the rest by customers of smud and other municipal utilities and  irrigation districts.  ""in one sense, we are all in this together. if smud were in danger of going  down, we would hope others would help us out,"" said smud's posner. ""but  that's if we're in danger from circumstances beyond our control, not from  mismanagement or lack of financial wherewithal.""  it is unclear what penalties, if any, a utility would face for violating an  interconnection agreement. in the long run, the issue would be fought either  in the courts or before the federal energy regulatory commission, grid  officials said.  as a practical matter, in the seconds when the risk to the grid is greatest,  if one utility refused to shed load, the iso would probably solve to problem  by calling on pg&e, edison or others who are willing to make deeper cutbacks,  they said. puc to decide fate of utility workers  pg&e, edison want to trim costs by laying off thousands, cutting service  bernadette tansey, chronicle staff writer state regulators are set to decide today whether debt-ridden pacific gas and  electric co. and southern california edison can conserve cash by laying off  thousands of workers and letting service standards slip.  union officials who protested the layoffs before the california public  utilities commission warn that if the cuts go through, neighborhoods hit by  power outages could stay dark for hours, and more customers could face busy  signals when they call about their bills.  an administrative law judge agreed, advising the commission in february to  order the utilities to restore 725 positions already cut and block the  judge john wong said pg&e and edison have acknowledged the layoffs will not  substantially improve their shaky financial condition, which arose from  skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs the utilities could not pass on to  consumers under a rate cap.  ""the savings would barely make a dent,"" wong said in his draft decision. the  two companies together claim that their debt from power purchases amounts to  wong's recommendation is already running into resistance on the puc.  commissioner richard bilas said the five-member panel should not be  micromanaging the utilities in a time of crisis.  bilas has proposed an alternate ruling that would allow the utilities to make  the cuts, but provide for puc monitoring of service in case the commission  wants to step in later.  ""we're in a situation where the utilities are not collecting the revenues  they need to operate, and yet we may be guilty of not letting them cut  expenses where they can cut expenses,"" bilas said.  pg&e spokesman jon tremayne said savings from the layoffs are helping to keep  electricity running and gas flowing.  ""it keeps cash in our accounts so we can keep doing day-to-day business,""  tremayne said.  additional 675 during the next three to six months. the cuts affect temporary  and contract workers who read meters, handle new service hookups and replace  equipment. pg&e has no plans to eliminate permanent positions.  the company is struggling to keep up with a higher workload at its call  center as customers deluge the lines with inquiries about their rising bills  and the effects of deregulation. calls to pg&e ballooned from 1.3 million in  bilas advocates granting pg&e's request to temporarily relax standards  requiring the utility to respond swiftly to customer calls and to read  customers' meters once a month. pg&e wants to read meters bimonthly and send  bills based on the estimated use between readings. discrepancies could be  corrected later.  wong called those measures unacceptable. he said customers need to know  immediately if their efforts to conserve power are working. wong also said  the utilities' own experts have said the workforce reductions will lengthen  the time required to restore power after nonemergency equipment failure.  eric wolfe, communications director for the international brotherhood of  electrical workers, local 1245, said some customers have already been left  without power overnight because pg&e is trying to avoid the use of overtime  on nonemergency power outages.  ""it hurts a lineman to walk away from the job leaving a customer without  power,"" wolfe said.  tremayne said pg&e is trying to minimize overtime costs, but denied the  company has allowed customers to go without power out of financial concerns.  he said crews were pulled out when darkness and falling trees made the work  too dangerous. power prices could soar during the summer  by steve johnson  mercury news  unless gov. gray davis arranges significantly more long-term electricity  contracts or persuades people to turn off a lot more lights, california's  unpredictable spot market for power could wreak havoc this summer.  even with the 40 long-term deals announced by davis on monday, experts  interviewed tuesday said, up to 43 percent of the state's daily needs may  have to come from this highly volatile market, in which power is bought  within a day of need. that could could prove hugely expensive, because some  spot market energy has cost five to six times what it would under the  long-term contracts.  it's widely expected that consumers ultimately would have to pay that tab,  which could amount to billions of dollars.  and because that power won't be locked up in contracts, there is no guarantee  it will be available when it's needed, which could lead to blackouts,  according to a recent report to the california independent system operator,  which oversees three-fourths of the state's power grid.  ``the situation in california could reach catastrophic proportions,'' the  report concluded, adding that unless things change dramatically, ``it is a  virtual certainty that peak demand will go unmet during many hot summer  steven maviglio, davis' press secretary, conceded tuesday that the spot  the state is trying to line up more power contracts, speed up power plant  construction and promote conservation.  during the normally hot month of august, peak daily demand for power in the  independent system operator's territory is expected to hit about

summer, and the state is still nearly  costly proposition  if all that power has to be obtained on the spot market, the price could be  high. on friday, last-minute purchases on the market averaged $411 per  megawatt-hour, compared to about $150 per megawatt-hour for all power  obtained by the independent system operator and $69 per megawatt-hour on  average under davis' long-term contracts.  california also might be able to trade for another 5,000 megawatts with the  federal government's bonneville power administration and a hydroelectric  operator in british columbia, said arthur o'donnell, editor of california  energy markets, a trade publication.  under such deals, those two outfits often send that much power to california  when they don't need it and california returns the same amount or more when  its demand is low.  this summer, because ``they still haven't gotten the snowpack they need in  the pacific northwest,'' which could limit that region's generating capacity.  still falling short  even if those hydropower imports are available and conservation works as  davis hopes, it's likely california would still require the spot market for  the state's overall power needs.  ``all of the surrounding states are buying probably less than 5 percent, at  most, of their energy on the spot market,'' said frank wolak, a stanford  economist, who monitors electricity prices for the independent system  operator. he worries about how much that power could cost and is disturbed  that state officials haven't adequately addressed the issue.  officials at pacific gas & electric co. are particularly concerned. they fear  of the spot market purchases by the independent system operator, which has  threatened to bill the utilities for the cost.  wants the tab sent to the department of water resources, which also is buying  power on the spot market for the state. but the department of water resources  has objected to that idea and the matter is expected to be heard today by the  california public utilities commission.  market will work ``and certainly that's one of them,'' said thomas hannigan,  the water agency's director.  added pg&e spokesman john nelson. but nettie hoge, executive director of the  utility reform network in san francisco, said she suspects consumers  ultimately will foot the bill.  the unfortunate likelihood about spot market purchases is that ``ratepayers  problem.'' power plant plans cause conflicts  east county residents blast supervisors  jason b. johnson, chronicle staff writer industry dreams of building new power plants in east contra costa's hills are  prompting an angry reaction among residents and elected officials who say  they don't want more plants.  the conflict was sparked by a vote by county supervisors yesterday to  aggressively explore possible sites for new power plants throughout the  county.  the measure by supervisors mark desaulnier and federal glover, which passed  on a 4-to-0 vote, directs the county administrator and department of  community development to compile a report on possible sites within 45 days.  supervisor donna gerber abstained after criticizing the plan for potentially  repeating the same mistakes that plagued the state's energy deregulation  effort by not considering how much energy the state, region and county will  need in future years, and how much power is slated to come online.  gerber said alternative power sources, such as solar, should also be  examined.  a site drawing much attention is on top of a deposit of natural gas near the  concord naval weapons station off highway 4.  the owners of 70 acres of land near the station recently formed a company,  golden state power co., to pursue construction of at least one small peaker  plant and a much larger facility capable of producing 600 megawatts.  the site could hold up to three small 50-megawatt peaker plants, and a larger  15-acre natural gas plant, said steve thomas, managing partner with golden

""when is enough, enough?"" asked aiello. ""pittsburg has shouldered  responsibility for a land-fill and two more power plants. at some point you  beals said that while power plants have added millions to the city's general  fund, the negatives of additional plants could outweigh the benefits.  ""i don't think that pittsburg or east county should be the dumping ground for  energy for california,"" said beals. supervisors set search for power plant sites  the board also heard from the potential developers of a 650-megawatt plant  between bay point and concord  by thomas peele times staff writer  toward allowing the construction of at least one small power plant before  summer, ordering that its staff identify potential sites in unincorporated  areas within seven weeks.  the board voted 4-0 to search for locations. third district supervisor donna  gerber abstained, saying her colleagues lacked a ""comprehensive context'' to  identify sites. ""i think the board knows just enough to be dangerous,'' she  said.  gerber said the county should examine the potential for additional power  plants within its borders but not investigate individual sites yet.  but fourth district supervisor mark desaulnier said the action was necessary  because of the energy crisis and because of gov. gray davis' call for local  governments to help speed the construction of so-called ""peaker plants""  before july and august.  ""i wouldn't do this except under an emergency,"" desaulnier said after the  vote. ""there are unusual circumstances. we're not talking about putting this  in a residential area.""  fifth district supervisor federal glover backed desaulnier, but said he hoped  for a location outside his heavily industrialized east county district.  said.  desaulnier said, though, that the only logical place for a small plant  remains the ""industrial belt'' stretching along the waterfront from west  county to antioch. he declined to provide specifics, but said the only other  potential site outside the industrial areas was the concord naval weapons  station property. but he quickly added that he believes the u.s. department  also, desaulnier said he could not rule out the county building the plant  itself and entering the electricity-selling market during peak demand times.  board chairwoman gayle uilkema called that idea extremely premature and  unlikely.

some reduction in traffic by using rush-hour diamond lanes or by  adjusting highway or (as in new york) bridge tolls to levels of congestion.  but as pointed out by david dowall, an urban economist at berkeley, state  policy-makers have not really begun to ""consider how demand management  strategies can be applied to infrastructure service areas,"" or how the more  in any case, says dowall in one of the ppic reports, we should pick which  major projects we will build not just according to per capita estimates of  how much we need, but according to how much consumers are willing to pay for  them.  to avoid hurting the poor, congestion-related highway tolls and other tariffs  can be rebated on the basis of income. university fees can be means-tested.  in california, they also could be adjusted to encourage summer school classes  and other off-peak uses, rather than (as in the past) making uc summer  courses more expensive.  given the political and economic uncertainties, there's no way to know how  far such demand management can be taken. but there's not much doubt that, as  dowall and others point out, the state's infrastructure planning is a jumble  of uncoordinated agency agendas and wish lists.  the legislature last year passed a bill, ab 1473, by assembly speaker robert  hertzberg, that requires the governor, beginning next year, to submit an  annual five-year infrastructure plan for state agencies and public schools,  along with recommendations on how to fund it. in addition, gov. gray davis'  infrastructure commission is expected to recommend better coordination of  infrastructure and land-use planning when it issues its report this spring.  that would be a start. as california state treasurer phil angelides has  long commutes; to preserve open space; and to bring jobs to where people live  and housing to where the jobs are. that would itself reduce demand for more  freeway lanes and, equally important, improve the quality of life.  at present, most planning for housing, roads, water systems and other  facilities rarely recognizes the regional impact of local decisions. in the  east bay, slow-growth forces push well-intended initiatives that would force  more development into tracy or modesto and further tax the transportation  systems to silicon valley. in city after city, there are beggar-thy-neighbor  efforts to grab yet another shopping mall that produces a little extra sales  tax revenue for the city that gets it, and that often compounds traffic and  revenue problems in adjacent communities.  in higher education we divide bond proceeds evenly among uc, the california  state university and the community colleges even though the community  colleges serve eight times as many students as uc. we plan road projects  according to county, not regional, priorities. it is all done according to  antiquated political and fiscal formulas that often no longer make sense. we  don't just need better capital planning; we need a whole new planning system. pg&e power plan debated at hearing a puc meeting on the utility's capacity expansion project for the tri-valley  follows weeks of protest from officials, residents  power upgrade in valley debated  by megan long times staff writer  subdivision faced questions tuesday about their opposition to alternative  by restating their long-standing objections.  tuesday's cross-examination came during the third and likely final week of  the california public utility commission's evidentiary hearings on the  followed weeks of protests of pg&e's upgrade plans by officials and residents  of livermore, pleasanton, dublin and san ramon.  and before the questioning started, dublin vice mayor janet lockhart  reiterated concerns about an alternative route deemed ""environmentally  superior"" that would place a substation just 1,000 feet north of interstate  580 between tassajara and fallon roads. she said that would undermine the  results of a 15-year process to plan the eastern development of the city.  ""it's extremely important to the residents of our community to follow a plan  we worked hard to produce,"" she said.  dublin officials favor pg&e's proposed placement of the station three miles  north of the freeway, away from new high-tech company offices and housing  developments. besides the dublin substation, the project calls for  construction of a substation in north livermore, expansion of the pleasanton  substation and installation of 23.5 miles of new lines.  in response to questions from puc administrative law judge michelle cooke,  dublin's public works director, lee thompson, confirmed that the lin family,  the owner of the property where the alternative substation would go, wasn't  interested in selling the land to pg&e.  cooke also asked thompson to define a ""discretionary permit,"" which is how  city officials said they might treat a permit for a substation. lee said that  type of permit is one the city has the right to approve or not depending on  the project's impact.  eddie peabody, dublin's community development director, testified that the  zoning for the lin property accommodates uses such as commercial business,  research and development and light manufacturing. it would not, he said, be  appropriate for a power substation.  he said parcels within the east dublin area that could host a station would  include those zoned for public and semi-public uses, including land recently  bought by oracle and sun microsystems for new campuses.  while dublin officials testified that one buyer of land in that area paid $86  per square foot, others suggested land prices would be inflated to help make  a pg&e land buy look prohibitively expensive.  an executive of centex homes, the developer of new houses near isabel avenue  and concannon boulevard, objected to an alternative route that would place  high-voltage transmission lines overhead along isabel and stanley boulevard.  david barclay, president of centex's northern california division, said that  of the prima tract.  ed o'neill, a lawyer for the kottinger ranch homeowners association, pointed  out that existing distribution lines on 50-foot poles on isabel already mar  the view for residents.  the foley family has been ranching on land south of pleasanton city limits  for years, said their attorney kennedy richardson. the utility's project  would place overhead lines and a transmission station on rolling hills that  the family envisions as one day being public open space with limited  development, richardson said.  lawyers for pleasanton, livermore, kottinger ranch and centex are scheduled  to cross-examine a pg&e engineer today about the project's routing. that  testimony should be the most controversial of the hearings. judge cooke is  expected to recommend an alignment by july to the puc, which will make the  final decision. news  state oks 'peaker' power plant at sfo / temporary generator could be sending  marshall wilson the san francisco chronicle  final  state energy officials yesterday approved plans to build a temporary  electrical plant at san francisco international airport that should generate  meeting in sacramento, the energy commission voted 4-0 to give the green  light to the gas-fired plant. it will operate during peak summer and winter  demand to help the state avoid stage 3 power alerts and rolling blackouts.  texas-based el paso merchant energy co. won approval under a new state law  mandating speedy, four-month reviews of so-called ""peaker"" plants. it was the  only one of seven applications statewide to win approval. the other proposals  were withdrawn for various reasons.  the 51-megawatt plant, formally called the united golden gate power project,  is scheduled to be built at the northwest corner of the airport near the  united airlines maintenance center.  $400 million plant in the same area, company spokesman jesse frederick said.  it would undergo a separate review by state energy officials.  the small ""peaker"" plant approved yesterday is to generate electricity  beginning around aug. 1 for up to three years. after the end of three years,  the plant would be closed or converted to a cleaner-burning system. under  state law, a temporary ""peaker"" plant is permitted to spew more air pollution  than a permanent plant.  el paso's temporary plant is to be built next to a co-generation plant  operated by united airlines. it would use existing connections for natural  gas and water supplies and tap into existing power transmission lines.  electricity generated by the plant would be pumped into the state's  electrical grid, energy commission spokesman gary fay said. it would also  serve as a backup for san francisco airport in case of a blackout.  no one spoke against the proposed plant at yesterday's commission meeting.  the proposal, however, has been criticized by area residents and  environmentalists worried about air pollution.  scott buschman, a professional photographer and san bruno resident, said  yesterday it was unjust that state officials 100 miles away in sacramento  approved a texas company's proposal to put a power plant on land owned by san  francisco.  ""the fact that they approved it without considering the public's concerns,  foremost air quality, is very disturbing,"" he said.  fay said the plant complies with clean-air standards.  answering the criticism about the location of yesterday's deliberation, he  said three hearings and several workshops were held in communities near the  airport.  crossed wires: major kinks emerge in gov. davis's plan to power california  by wall street journal staff reporters rebecca smith, mitchel benson and john  r. emshwiller the wall street journal biggest bet in the history of the nation's biggest state: that he could tame  an out-of-control electricity market and avoid devastating blackouts without  busting the state's budget, antagonizing its consumers or derailing his own  political career.  his wager is still on the table, but the assumptions that underlie it are  looking increasingly shaky these days. the governor has already spent around  $2 billion of public money buying hugely expensive wholesale power, taking  over the role formerly played by the state's near-bankrupt electric  utilities. and california will probably be obliged to spend billions more  before its electricity market stabilizes and those utilities are restored to  some semblance of financial health. under the governor's plan, california aims to recoup the money it is using to  buy electricity by issuing $10 billion in bonds. that way it would still have  a healthy budget surplus to finance new spending on roads, schools and other  public services. but there's a potentially big obstacle to this plan. the  state legislature, worried about racking up billions in new debt, has put  limits on the size of any bond offering. in broad terms, the legislature's  action would allow the state to borrow only four times as much as it can  recover annually from utility customers.  right now that doesn't appear to be much. under the current rate structure,  essentially set in place by california's flawed 1996 electricity-deregulation  plan, consumers pay far less for power than the cost of acquiring it on the  wholesale market. preliminary estimates submitted by utilities last month to  the california public utilities commission show the state's share of the  proceeds from electricity sales this year could be as little as $241 million  legislature's formula.  that would leave the state on the hook for much of the money it has already  spend. that, in turn, raises the prospect that california's economy and its  credit rating both could deteriorate significantly. but state finance  officials say that, based on their own projections, they will be able to  extract enough money to support a $10 billion bond issue.  walking a careful line between fiscal prudence and political survival, mr.  davis and others in his administration are scrambling to come up with ways to  get around the legislative restrictions without raising rates for consumers.  davis says.  the governor says he believes that the state can obtain enough affordable  power through long-term power-supply contracts to avoid the need for a big  rate increase. the billions of dollars the state hopes to borrow would be  used to help pay for power until electricity prices drop, as they are  expected to do when new power plants come online over the next few years.  to seek new electricity laws through a statewide ballot initiative during  next year's election. that's when mr. davis is expected to run for a second  term as governor.  but trying to save california without rate increases is forcing mr. davis to  make some colossal gambles with the state's money. state officials estimate  that in the next several months, california will need to spend as much as $6  surplus. mr. davis is also looking to spend several billion more to buy the  transmission assets of three investor-owned utilities in order to restore two  of them to credit-worthiness. he also has announced plans to spend several  hundred million dollars more on conservation programs designed to reduce  demand while new power plants are being built in the state.  in order to limit the state's financial exposure in the meantime, the  governor and his aides have, in some cases, ignored state law. they have  threatened appointed officials who have stood in the way. and they have  sharply restricted the flow of information to the public.  none of those steps is expected to do much to reduce state spending on power  in the coming months. in a few weeks, power usage is expected to begin a  sharp seasonal rise as californians switch on their air conditioners with the  coming of warmer weather. by various estimates, demand during peak periods  this summer could outstrip supply by 10%, or several thousand megawatts. that  could produce more rolling blackouts like the ones that hit northern  california earlier this year. it is also likely to put strong upward pressure  on wholesale electricity prices.  steven zimmerman, managing director of standard & poor's corp., says mr.  financial exposure to the crisis. the credit-rating agency has put the state  on credit watch for a possible downgrade, which would affect the value of all  of california's outstanding public debt. moody's investor service inc. is  also concerned. it said in a recent report that the power crisis could soon  ""seriously threaten the health"" of the state's economy.  mr. davis, a democrat and career politician, was dealt a bad hand when he  electricity crisis was enacted under his predecessor, republican pete wilson.  but mr. davis was slow to react to early signs of trouble this past summer  and alarms sounded by members of the state legislature. by the time mr. davis  finally sprang into action earlier this year, a troublesome power-supply  squeeze had escalated into a crisis.  in a jan. 17 declaration of emergency, the governor designated the state  department of water resources to take the utilities' place as the daily buyer  of huge quantities of electricity. his hope: that by making the state the  dominant player in california's power sector, he would ease electricity  producers' concerns about getting paid and give the state enough clout to  negotiate lower long-term power prices.  earlier this week, mr. davis announced final or tentative agreements with 20  periods of as long as 20 years. but the supply situation remains extremely  uncertain for this summer, when demand probably will top 45,000 megawatts. if  the state can secure enough power under contract and push down demand through  aggressive conservation, it might be able to squeak through the summer  season. if not, it will be forced to keep buying huge amounts of costly power  in the cash market.  under deregulation, retail electric rates were frozen for several years,  while wholesale-power costs were free to fluctuate. when the plan was  conceived, wholesale prices were low and expected to go lower. however, a  combination of unexpected growth in power demand and a lack of new generating  capacity helped produce a supply squeeze. average wholesale prices more than  a year earlier.  & electric unit of pg&e corp. and the southern california edison subsidiary  up billions of dollars in wholesale power bills they couldn't afford to pay.  as generators began shying away from selling to the two utilities, the  clinton administration forced them to sell power into the california market,  an order left in place during the first weeks of the bush administration.  still, northern california was hit by rolling blackouts on several days in  early january.  since then, the dwr, which does some electricity trading as an adjunct to its  main mission of managing the state's giant system of aqueducts and  reservoirs, has had to learn the ins and outs of power markets on the run. it  hasn't been easy.  david mills, trading-floor manager for the federal bonneville power  per megawatt hour more than the available market price. ""they agree to prices  that make you wonder,"" says mr. mills, whose organization markets electricity  from federal dams in the pacific northwest. ""you'd at least think they'd  check to see what the prevailing price is before throwing out their offer.""  mr. mills says that ""to cut california some slack,"" he occasionally has  instructed his traders to sell at prices lower than the dwr had offered to  pay.  ray hart, the water agency deputy director responsible for the power  purchasing, says he isn't aware of any cases in which the dwr has overpaid.  he says his team has been ""extremely successful by all measures.""  ultimately, the dwr's trading acumen is far less important than the overall  arithmetic of power supply and demand in california. with the price of  natural gas that feeds many of the region's generating plants at near record  levels and some suppliers reluctant to sell into the troubled california  market, wholesale electric prices remain stubbornly high and, in recent days,  have again been rising.  the legislature has advanced the dwr about $3 billion from the state's  general fund for power purchases. under emergency legislation passed by the  legislature and signed by mr. davis on feb. 1, the general fund is to be  reimbursed from a planned bond sale later this year. but under terms of the  emergency law, the water agency would have to wrest $2.5 billion a year in  revenue from retail electricity rates in order to sell the $10 billion worth  of bonds sought by mr. davis.  assembly speaker robert hertzberg, a southern california democrat, says the  formula was created to ensure that there would be a way to repay the bonds  without draining the state's coffers. ""we didn't want to just open our  wallets,"" he says.  according to the language of the feb. 1 law, the water agency gets what's  left of revenue collected from ratepayers after the utilities pay certain of  their own power-supply bills and other expenses. and, in their filings with  the puc last month, the utilities reckoned, under their worst-case scenarios,  state officials are quietly pushing the puc to rejigger the formula so that  terms of the feb. 1 law. robert miyashiro, deputy director of the department  of finance, says the emergency law was ""drafted poorly"" and has led people to  believe the dwr ""only gets the leftover money."" he predicts there will be  ""cleanup legislation.""  at the request of the davis administration, the puc is considering a plan to  use a different revenue-sharing formula than the one in the state law. the  proposed new formula was written ""in close consultation"" with mr. davis's  finance department, says puc president loretta lynch, who supports the  initiative and is hoping to rush it through.  the effort has drawn some opposition. commissioner richard bilas at a recent  puc meeting questioned the legality of the commission attempting to change a  formula set by the legislature. pg&e is even more emphatic, since the dwr's  extra money could come at the utility's expense. the formula ""threatens to  undo the very financial protections for the utilities that [the new law]  attempted to provide,"" the utility said in a recent filing with the puc.  as politicians and regulators wrestle with that issue, the davis  administration has taken a step to reduce the outflow of state cash that also  seems to conflict with the feb. 1 law. it was widely assumed that the law  required the dwr to buy any electricity the state needed to keep its lights  on. however, on many occasions, the dwr has refused to buy power on the  grounds that it was too expensive, citing a portion of the new law that urges  the agency to hold down costs.  the task of covering any remaining shortfall has passed to the california  independent system operator, which manages the state's energy grid and is  charged with buying power when necessary to avert shortages. however, the iso  doesn't have any power-purchasing money of its own, and the major parties it  would normally bill are pg&e and edison, whose inability to pay their power  bills was the reason the state started buying electricity in the first place.  amid criticism of its stance from generators, utilities and wall street, the  dwr says it has started covering more of the utilities' electricity costs.  day, says the agency's mr. hart. but increased buying only adds to the  uncertainty about the eventual tab.  the state's legislative analyst, elizabeth hill, recently recommended that  lawmakers hold off considering more than $2 billion in state spending on  items ranging from college construction to beach cleanups because of  continuing questions about the financial impact of the electricity crisis.  like others, ms. hill complains that the governor's office and state agencies  haven't been forthcoming with information.  indeed, the dwr refuses to say precisely how much power it is purchasing and  at what prices, though it has on several occasions gone back to the  legislature for more money. state officials say that data on its purchasing  activities would give suppliers an advantage in continuing electricity-supply  contract talks.  state controller kathleen connell, who is running for mayor of los angeles in  an april election, recently announced plans to post state power-spending  information on her department's web site. but within 24 hours, ms. connell  suspended that plan after discussions with senior davis administration  officials. ""i feel very strongly that this information should be publicly  released,"" says ms. connell. ""i just don't want to do anything that would  weaken the state's effectiveness in negotiating.""  in an effort to more tightly control events, the governor obtained  legislative approval to abolish the 26-member iso board, which was made up of  everyone from utility executives to representatives of consumer groups. he  then appointed a new five-member board. to ensure a quick transition, the  california attorney general threatened the old board members with fines of as  much as $5,000 each if they didn't immediately relinquish their positions.  all did. ""i was offended"" at the ""heavy-handed"" treatment, says karen  johanson, a former iso board member.  electricity crisis. the former iso board routinely held such meetings in  public. iso attorneys say the meeting was largely designed as a private  briefing for new board members and that the organization is committed to  keeping its deliberations as open as possible. the wall street journal and  other news organizations have unsuccessfully challenged the closure in  sacramento state court.",0

""stagflation"" refers to stagnant economic conditions and  though the advisers painted perhaps the dreariest outlook yet to come from  the governor's office, they said that the davis plan for financing the  state's electricity purchases remains intact. as reported, the state plans to  purchasing electricity since january, when its failed utility-deregulation  plan left california's two biggest utilities financially unable to continue  buying power. if price caps were instituted, the state might have to borrow less money than  anticipated or at least face a decreased danger of having to borrow more if  the power situation gets worse, said joseph fichera, chief executive of new  york-based saber partners llc and an adviser to mr. davis. months, as supplies are increased with new power plants due to come into  operation, the advisers said. however, mr. bush and other federal officials  have repeatedly said that they believe price caps would be counterproductive  and discourage the building of new power plants. write to john r. emshwiller at john.emshwiller@wsj.com1 copyright 2001 associated press ap online section: domestic, non-washington, general news item byline: jerome minerva body: ??nato won't back u.s. missile plan ??nato's top policy-making body stopped short of endorsing the bush administration's plan for a national missile defense today, preparing to offer only to ''continue substantive consultations'' with washington. the north atlantic council does not portray the possibility of missile attack as a  common threat faced by allies, as the bush administration had hoped, it said in a statement. secretary of state colin powell had hoped to persuade skeptical  nato allies to be more supportive of u.s. missile defense plans. ??pakistan accepts india offer to talk ??pakistani military ruler gen. pervez musharraf today accepted india's offer to hold peace talks on the disputed kashmir region and other issues.

""but they're not  going to have enough new capacity online this summer to avoid blackouts."" ??so the energy woes continue to fester in california. it's not just electricity and rolling blackouts. gasoline prices of $2-and-more-a-gallon  have become commonplace as well. ??""the gas bothers me more than the electric,"" said tait kmentt, who runs a legal process serving business in irvine, calif.

""we think that's a mistake,"" vice president dick cheney said on friday, talking about  why he rejected those options when he prepared the energy policy the  administration ??but mr. bush knows that how he handles the california energy crisis could prove critical to his political fortunes, especially now that his party's loss of control in the senate seems bound to slow or derail passage of major  elements of his energy plan. ??moreover, the president can no longer argue that the best cure for high energy prices is a tax cut, because that is now legislative history. as one of his aides said this weekend, after congress approved the $1.35 trillion tax  cut the other arguments."" ??most of those arguments involve urging the rest of the country not to follow california in a partial deregulation of the market, with disastrous results. ??repeatedly mr. bush has chastised california's politicians, and by implication mr. davis himself, for ignoring politically unpalatable choices to avert the state's power-generating crisis. ten days ago, standing in front of  a hydroelectric plant in pennsylvania, mr. bush used the state as exhibit a for his argument about what happens when population rises, when over-regulation freezes the construction of new power plants and the stringing of new transmission lines, and when politicians fail to plan for the long term. ??""the problems in california shows that you cannot conserve your way to  energy independence,"" mr. bush said then. ??at the same time, his aides were pointing to polls showing mr. davis's approval ratings plunging. they did not mention that mr. bush's ratings in the state were hardly any better. a series of recent polls show that roughly two-thirds of californians believe mr. bush should be doing far more to help  the state, though it is unclear exactly what kind of help they have in mind. ??so mr. bush's aides have been struggling for days to choreograph the two-day visit here, trying to find ways to differ with mr. davis without seeming  callous about the problem or in conflict with the state. ??the betting is that mr. bush will focus on long-term solutions, in contrast to mr. davis's call for the quicker fix of price caps. ??the effort started today. energy secretary spencer abraham issued an order  of chiefly symbolic importance, saying his department would move quickly to determine whether investors were interested in financing and co-owning a new transmission line that could bring more power to the state. ??""the level of interest will be a factor in the decision to build the line later this year,"" the energy department said. it said that it would proceed  with studies of how the land could be acquired, by eminent domain if necessary, and that it would speed ahead with environmental reviews. ??but mr. abraham left wide open the question of whether washington would go ahead with the project even if no private financing was available. ??""the bush administration is taking a leadership role in addressing a long-neglected problem in california's electricity transmission system,"" mr. abraham said. ""california's electricity problems developed over a period of years and cannot be solved overnight. however, we can move now on actions that will help avert the same types of problems from recurring year after year."" ??the statement was clearly intended as a prelude to the meeting with mr. davis, which will be closed to the press. so will a meeting with energy entrepreneurs.

""customer demand has shot through the roof,"" says angelina galiteva, executive director for strategic planning at  the department of water and power. she estimates that her department receives  calls on some days about its solar subsidy program. ???yet while the reliability and cost of solar electric technologies continue to improve, solar power today accounts for only a sliver of the national pie single mid-sized traditional power plant. ???the current trend for photovoltaics is not to erect large centralized solar farms in the desert, an experiment that withered in the 1980s, but to pursue ""distributed generation"" or individual units on scattered rooftops. ???the problem has consistently been the cost of the solar panels, which has been too steep to justify them, except for customers who are committed environmentalists or techies who like the elegance of the systems. ???los angeles began its solar experiment after sacramento legislators  mandated that utilities spend about 3 percent of their revenue on efficiency, conservation and renewable energy. for solar, the power department committed $ homes. residence or business. homeowners typically purchase a one-kilowatt or two- up lawanda geary in the san fernando valley, who in april had owen install 32 panels for a two-kilowatt system on her sunny roof. ""the rebate really got me going. i don't know many times when the government offers to pay half of anything."" ???the systems that are eligible for rebates must be tied into a utility's electric power grid, meaning that during the day, when the sun is shining, the panels are adding a stream of electrons used by the home to run its lights and appliances. ???if there is a surplus of solar power, that electricity goes back into the power lines and is passed along to a neighbor, and the electric meter at the house actually runs backward. homeowners, however, are not selling their  excess energy, but getting its electricity the traditional way from the power lines. ???calculations on savings vary. a two-kilowatt solar system can supply an average-sized home with 20 to 80 percent of its electrical needs, depending on how many lights, appliances and air conditioners are running, and how  efficient they are. with borrowed funds), a solar system can pay for itself in as little as six ???potential solar clients, moreover, often mistakenly assume that going with the sun will take them off the grid, which is not possible without a large  bank of batteries that costs several thousand dollars more. because the solar  panels are still wired to the power grid, if there is a blackout, the power in a  solar house goes off, just like everyone else's. if uninterrupted power is needed, owen suggests a diesel generator. ???galiteva does cite one real advantage of solar: it reduces the electricity that must be purchased from power companies and protects, to some degree, a solar home from the full brunt of upwardly spiraling rate increases. unfortunately for solar enthusiasts, the l.a. department of water and power, which was not deregulated along with the three other major utilities in california, has perhaps the cheapest and most stable supply of electricity in the state, making the economic argument harder to make. power requires a homeowner to purchase solar panels from a manufacturer based  in the city. the idea is not only to become the solar capital of the world but  also to encourage local growth of an emerging industry and create jobs. ???one hitch is that no solar panel makers were located in los angeles. ???after lengthy negotiations, siemens solar industries, based in camarillo, calif., an hour's drive to the north, announced in february that it would  open a solar panel manufacturing plant in los angeles. but it is not a complete facility: the l.a. plant does only some final assembly and then the units must be returned to camarillo for final testing and shipping. ???tina nickerson, a spokeswoman for siemens solar, estimates her company has sold ""a couple dozen"" to l.a. homeowners for the rebate program. but she, too, reports that the interest from consumers is sometimes overwhelming and that supply has been a problem. most u.s.-manufactured units are shipped overseas  to places such as germany, japan and scandinavia, which have had generous  subsidies in place for years. ???lawanda geary had to call siemens herself to push them to deliver panels  for compromise that allows to siemens to ship solar panels from camarillo until its l.a.  plant is fully operational. ???everyone involved concedes there have been bottlenecks. siemens now says it has enough panels to begin to meet demand, and owen and the city are hoping things will sort themselves out, especially if more solar manufacturers are drawn to los angeles. but proponents worry about what will happen when the subsidies run out. week. it's getting them up on the

electrical generating capacity. ?the price wholesale power providers can charge utilities is not capped, but the fee those companies can charge users is capped - resulting in massive debt for providers. ??the state was slow to respond to increased demand, the analysts say, even though the state is building 10 new power plants, four of which will come on line this summer. on increasing domestic supply, improving the nation's ability to move energy between regions and increased conservation. ?but the policy is geared more toward long-term solutions - such as decreasing america's reliance on foreign oil - than short-term relief for californians and motorists nationwide. ??mr. ?cheney, who heads the president's energy task force and said friday  that california knew ""for more than a year"" about the impending energy shortage,  has promoted nuclear power as essential to america's energy needs. ?he said that  at future electricity demand ought to be nuclear. ??a poll by the

the impending summer emergency  better look for some other solution. ??even the short-term price fix that the federal energy regulatory commission may consider at its wednesday meeting might be too little too late. ??lobbyists, lawmakers and other ferc-watchers say they have seen a slight shift in recent weeks among commission staff and at least one member. there is some willingness, they say, to consider some price controls, even though the bush administration is adamantly opposed to such measures. ??many are looking to see if president bush's choices for the two vacancies on ferc will provide a margin for change. ??but the commission's basic philosophy that open, unregulated markets are  best is not likely to change soon, members say. ??""i've been championing a revamping of ferc's antiquated standards for determining market-based rates,"" commissioner richard massey said thursday.  but market-based pricing."" ??the standards are a joke, massey added, because the commission never turns down requests for such pricing authority. more than 600 power sellers have  been given that authority, he said. ??for a power company to be allowed to charge whatever the market will bear,  it must show ferc, for example, that it doesn't have the power to manipulate the market and drive prices up. ??""any seller that can't pass our screen needs to fire their consultants and lawyers,"" massey said. ??while the overall philosophy remains consistent, ferc staff has proposed to the commission that a stage 3 electricity emergency in california should  trigger cost-based rates, a form of price controls. such triggers would be in place  for one year, under the staff proposal. ??the commission may decide wednesday whether to accept that proposal. it has to make some decision by may 1 on how the market will be monitored from now  on. ??the theory behind controlling prices in stage 3, says a ferc staff report,  is that during such an emergency generators have the greatest opportunity to manipulate the market and drive prices up. ??but generators have that power during stage 2 and stage 1 emergencies, says les starck, southern california edison co.'s manager of federal regulatory affairs. price caps during stage 3 might avert the rolling blackouts  associated with that level of crisis, but they wouldn't do anything to stop generators  from jacking up prices the rest of the time, he said. ??it is not clear how long it would take for such price controls to take effect, should the commission go along with the staff recommendation. ??""we're close because summer is approaching,"" commissioner linda breathitt said thursday. breathitt, who had firmly opposed any form of price controls, said in an interview last month that given the worsening crisis in california she was open to considering some short-term measures. ??""it's important to me that we address the summer,"" breathitt said, but said she wasn't able to predict what the commission would do wednesday. ??even if an order is approved, massey said, there could be delays while the power sellers file their costs with regulators and disputes over those filings are handled. ??sen. dianne feinstein said thursday such a move by the commission would be ""better than having no controls at all. there's no question that we're going  to ??feinstein, d-calif., and other western lawmakers have been urging ferc to step in sooner and with price controls that extend beyond just the emergency period. roger hamilton, a member of oregon's public utility commission. ""we have a  real stability problem when you cut it that close."" ??feinstein says the future could well rest with the new commissioners, particularly patrick wood, the head of the texas puc who many believe will replace curt heber as ferc chairman if he is confirmed by the senate. ??even if massey and breathitt agree on broader price controls, as chairman, heber could block consideration of such a move. it's unclear what stance wood would take as chairman. feinstein said. ""what's reassuring is that it appears from my personal discussion with him is that he appears to be pragmatic."" ??but once again, timing could be a problem. ??bush has said he intends to nominate wood and nora brownell, a member of the pennsylvania puc, but has not formally sent their nominations to the senate. ??""the federal energy regulatory commission is of vital importance right now, and to let the time go on without filling the spots makes no sense,"" feinstein said.

""it signals to me that it could delay the financing process."" ??a second concern is that the state isn't collecting as much in taxes as expected, cohen said. tax collections for both february and march were below forecast. the amount of personal income tax the state collected in those  months ??cohen said she made her decision before hearing that the state's power costs now exceed $70 million a day. cohen and david hitchcock, the california  analyst for standard & poors, agreed those rising costs are a definite concern. projected fund balances disappear and so we're very worried about what the current economic activity is, particularly in northern california with some of the problems with the high tech area,"" hitchcock told analysts and investors last week in a conference call. ??state treasurer phillip angelides was traveling thursday and couldn't be reached for comment. other economy-watchers expressed concern. ??sandy harrison, assistant director of the state dept. of finance, said the move reinforced the importance of solving the current power problems soon. ??""it's important to note that the rating hasn't been lowered yet and does remain very strong,"" he said. ??krt california is a premium service of knight ridder/tribune ??visit mercury center, the world wide web site of the mercury news, at http://www.sjmercury.com/ journal-code: sj section: state and regional news headline: issues still remain on what power consumers will eventually pay byline: by john woolfolk and michael bazeley body: ??san jose, calif. _ state regulators last month announced an electric rate increase that would average a whopping three cents per kilowatt hour, hit  bills beginning in may and punish power pigs while sparing energy misers. ??higher rates are surely coming _ but not before june. exactly which  consumers and businesses will pay how much is uncertain as regulators rush to forge a  rate structure from a tangle of more than 20 proposals. ??their task has been complicated immeasurably by gov. gray davis' decision to weigh in with a competing rate plan and pacific gas & electric's move into bankruptcy court. ??""little details are moving billions of dollars around,"" said nettie hoge of consumer advocate group turn. ??all the proposals assume a ""tiered"" structure that forces the heaviest users of energy to pay the most. but key details yet to be decided mean consumers could see their average rates go up anywhere from 7 percent to 30 percent or more. ??_how much of an overall increase? the public utilities commission approved a 3-cent per kilowatt hour increase last month, which would boost utility  revenue customers of southern california edison. ??_what regions of the state will pay?

if so, those users will find themselves paying much more  than any of the average increase figures being tossed about. ??_how will utilities bill customers retroactively for the increase? at the time of the puc vote on march 27, commissioner said their increase would take effect immediately. ??various plans are being presented this week to an administrative law judge working for the commission. the judge is expected to recommend a rate  structure would vote on a plan may 14, condensing to a few weeks a process that normally lasts nearly a year. ??each of the major proposals before the commission assumes that residential customers using less than 130 percent of their baseline would be exempt from higher rates. that's mandated under a new law that allows the state to buy power. customers already pay higher rates for exceeding their baseline, which  is the average basic level of use for each region of the state. ??each major proposal also sets new ""tiers"" with progressively higher rates  for percent of that level. ??but that's where the similarities end. ??the first distinction among the leading plans comes in the form of an assumption: how many residential customers will avoid any increase because  they don't exceed 130 percent of their baseline? davis says more than half, commissioners say a little under half and pg&e says less than a third. ??the second difference among the plans is a real difference: what happens to everyone else? ??under the plan by utilities commission president loretta lynch, medium pg&e users would see average bills rise 9 percent and heavy users would see bills increase 36 percent. while heavy users would pay 37 percent more. but the average total bill  increase for pg&e residential customers, including those who are exempt, would be 20 percent under his plan and 24 percent under lynch's, according to a statement  on the governor's web site. ??business customers would see proportionately greater increases, averaging 30 percent under lynch's proposal and 26 percent under davis'. ??the most consumer-friendly of the various proposals comes from consumer-rights group turn. they suggest an overall average residential  increase ??turn's plan assumes utilities cannot charge other customers more to make up for the energy misers shielded from rate increases under state law. ??pg&e disagrees with that interpretation. the utility wants other residential users to make up for any lost revenue from exempted customers through higher rates. under the utility's plan, residential customers would see an average  rate ??""the proposal these folks are pushing rips the heart out of that law,"" said matthew freedman, staff attorney for turn. ??another issue affecting consumers is how the utilities can bill for electricity used in april and may, before the final plan is approved. ??utility officials have objected to making the rate structure retroactive. instead, to recoup the revenue, they are proposing a flat surcharge that everyone would pay, regardless of how much they use. ??edison proposes a higher surcharge added to bills for a shorter period of time _ in this case, june through august. pg&e officials are suggesting a smaller surcharge that would be spread out over 12 months. ??""it'll probably be something closer to the pg&e proposal,"" paul clanon, the commission's director of energy issues. ??all the rate increase proposals stem from a commonly understood problem: california's current, frozen rates don't generate enough money to cover the kilowatt hour _ in january in an attempt to help, but that turned out to be  far from enough. ??in march, the commission approved an additional 3-cent increase. but davis followed quickly with an alternative proposal. the next day, pg&e filed for bankruptcy, raising the specter that a federal judge could order even higher rates. ??although the puc has sole authority to raise rates under state law, davis' proposal has complicated an already complex process. the governor appointed three of the five members of the commission, and his appointees seem inclined  to show him deference. but davis has been slow in filing the details of his plan, which has made it hard for the puc to proceed. ??krt california is a premium service of knight ridder/tribune ??visit mercury center, the world wide web site of the mercury news, at http://www.sjmercury.com/ journal-code: sj headline: edison pushes lawmakers to accept deal source: chronicle staff writer byline: david lazarus body: although lawmakers are skeptical of the state's multibillion-dollar deal to acquire the power lines of southern california edison, the head of the  utility's parent company warned yesterday that failure to approve the accord could lead  to a ""long and costly"" bankruptcy. ???but john bryson, chief executive of edison international, told the  chronicle that he thought legislators would ""want to do the right thing"" by approving  the multibillion-dollar agreement and preventing edison from following pacific gas and electric co. into bankruptcy court. ???bankruptcy for california's two largest utilities could have severe consequences for consumers. financial analysts said a worsening of the state's energy mess would increase the possibility of higher electricity rates. not in its present form. ???""we are going to go through this thing extensively,"" said state senate president pro tem john burton, d-san francisco.

""it's obviously way higher than $100 million."" ??natural gas rates at the california border generally tracked national prices until november, when they spiked as high as 11 times higher than the price of natural gas elsewhere in the nation, carpenter said. ??""i have never seen gas prices like this anywhere in the world,"" said carpenter, who has been studying the energy market for 20 years for cambridge, mass.-based consultant the brattle group. the brattle group was hired by  edison to study the natural gas market. ??the committee is one of two legislative committees exploring whether illegal market manipulation in the electricity and natural gas markets has driven up california's energy costs. ??""this is a market that is plagued by the exercise of market power,"" frank wolak, chairman of the california independent system operator's market surveillance committee, told the senate select committee to investigate price manipulation of the wholesale energy market. the iso runs the state's power grid. wolak said. market manipulation only becomes illegal when there is collusion, wolak said, and such evidence is hard to find. ??electricity generators and natural gas suppliers say a severe supply and demand imbalance - not market manipulation - has led to higher prices. ??""everybody's busy doing investigations. they're not interested in solving  the problem,"" said independent energy producers executive director jan  smutny-jones. ??investigations ""are wasting everybody's time,"" smutny-jones said, adding  that previous probes and lawsuits have uncovered no wrongdoing. he said the state's power problems came because state regulators denied utilities the chance to  sign long-term energy contracts when they had the chance. ??""people have been playing by the rules,"" smutny-jones said. ??but the senate committee's first witnesses are iso officials who authored studies that claim the state paid more than $6 billion too much for power last year. ??committee chair joseph dunn, d-garden grove, also has slated state auditor elaine howell, who last month blamed buyers and sellers for skyrocketing electricity costs. dunn also has scheduled future testimony from state,  federal, academic and private investigators studying the power market. ??he invited five major generators to attend the committee's second hearing next week. all five - reliant, dynegy, williams energy, duke energy and  say they are eager to cooperate and clear their names, dunn said. ??dunn asked the five for a total of 86 specific documents. if the companies feel they cannot provide documents because of legal or confidentiality  concerns, dunn said he will subpoena them. ??smutny-jones said investigators appear to be growing desperate to blame the state's natural gas and electricity price hikes on illegal market manipulation instead of natural market forces. ??he cited attorney general bill lockyer's announcement last week that any informant who helped prove wrongdoing would be entitled to a percentage of the state's recovery he estimated could range from $50 million to hundreds of millions of dollars. smutny-jones said. ""i don't think you're going to find the fact that anybody  did anything criminal here."" ??assemblywoman jenny oropeza, d-long beach, said she believes otherwise after wednesday's testimony: ""i think it is very clear there was some price manipulation going on."" ??but assemblyman john campbell, r-irvine, isn't sure there was anything illegal. ??""there clearly are market forces at work, that's evident,"" campbell said.

"as to electricity, during the several days of debate this week both chairmen tauzin and barton reaffirmed their intention to next move to electricity issues.  mr. barton's staff advised me this morning that the subcommittee he chairs will hold a hearing on friday, july 20th on all electricity issues other than transmission.  while mr.  barton has publicly held out hope of marking up an electricity bill this month, sources on and off the committee do not see this timetable as realistic.  on the senate side, the majority staff is working on an electricity ""white paper"" that may be circulated for comment next week. below is a recap of action on amendments of interest to enron: 1.	last night, on a largely partisan vote (with democrats hall, green and john voting with the republicans) the committee rejected an amendment by rep. jane harman (d-ca) (that was to have been offered by rep. anna eshoo (d-ca)) that would have retroactively amended the ferc refund date and essentially ordered refunds regardless of amounts owed to power sellers. 2.	first thing this morning the committee, again on a largely partisan basis (with democrats hall, green, john and towns), rejected a waxman amendment to impose cost-of-service rates on all power in the west (other than generation added after 1/1/01).  (originally, mr. waxman was going to offer amendment to impose cost-of-service rates only on those who do not supply all available power during an emergency, but he ended up offering basically what he had pursued in subcommittee on the old ""californa only"" bill.) 3.	the committee adopted an amendment by rep. shadegg to amend the natural gas act to make it clear that a natural gas ""transportation facility"" shall not be added to the national register of historic places until ferc has abandoned the facility.  apparently there have been some instances of ""old"" pipelines being considered as ""historic places"" under federal law.  the house resources committee added a similar amendment to its package yesterday. 4.	by voice vote, the committee rejected a waxman amendment to require the president to propose and implement a plan to bring u.s. greenhouse gases down to 1990 levels.  there was strong opposition voiced by many republicans and democrats to this amendment. 5.	by mixed vote of 24 to 29, the committee defeated a waxman amendment to set cost and performance goals for renewables, including wind power, and authorize federal funds to assist with commercial project costs (up to 50 percent).",0

"i agree with mark's points.  while we have advocated our merger with pge  (which did not concentrate market power) we have intervened in opposition to  most others.  moreover, there is some hope that the german government will  take the opportunity to use the proposed utility merger to force greater open  access.   we will likely encourage that action and may oppose the merger  otherwise.   most mergers in this industry are defensive, not procompetitive,  and, in my view, deserve no credit for convergence, innovation, or  liberlization. mark schroeder@ect margaret - apologies for the delay in getting comments to you on your  speech.  due to press of other matters i will be brief. first, your speech caption, refernecing ""mergers"" is somewhat different than  the topic shown in the agenda, i.e., ""industry structure and competitive  behaviour"", but i trust you are wroking that out with the biee.   second, in your first paragraph, you note that developments in the energy  sector over the last decade are due to the mergers of the last five years (a  point i will retrun to later), but in any event, not entirely consistent in  terms of timeframes. third, i am surprised that the enron corp. view is that gas and electricity  markets grew as they did over the decade due to mergers.  in the past, things  like unbundling and non-discriminatory third-party access have featured  prominently in our advocacy.  indeed, though it was not my role at enron, i  would have thought that in many of the recent electricity mergers pre-dating  order no. 888 we would have joined the chorus of voices arguing that these  mergers concentrated market power, and that such market power could only be  mitigated with the provision of non-discriminatory third-party access (an  argument we will be repeating in, e.g., germany, as noted below).  finally, i  would note that in the past, i thought we had questioned the value of mergers  as an impediment to competitive markets, as i recall ken rice gave an  infamous address/speech, in which he described ""good"" mergers and ""bad""  mergers, i.e., defensive mergers like houston industries and noram.  i  actually borrowed heavily from that speech two years ago, in paris, but if we  have changed our tune, that is good to know.  even the ""good"" mergers  identified in his/my speech, e.g., enron/portland, have had the ""goods""  thwarted, in part, by regulators, who would not let us do all we wanted to do  that was pro-competitive.  also, in the past, we have used as a good example  of ""convergence"" the arbitrage we have done at sithe's facility in ny,  electricity alone.  not clear to me that mergers in the us demonstrate this.   fourth, accepting that it is the enron corp. view that mergers are symbolic  of the convergence of gas and electricity, and are what yield the many  beneifts of competition that you dsicuss elsewhere in your speech (i do, of  course, agree with all the platitueds that competition yilds more service  offerings, innovation, etc.), you should be aware, coming over to this  market, that a number of mergers are taking place that we have expressed  concerns about in comments to the regulators, and will do so in the future.   here are some you should be aware of:  veical integration in the uk  electricity industry (not clear yet that this will result in better/more  service, but definitely loss of counter-parties, re-bundling of business  before retail unbundling/competition has taken hold); exxon/mobil  (consolidation in the upstream sector in continental europe, which is already  concentrated), veba/viag in germany (probalby okay, assuming thrid-party  access is allowed/enhanced to the wires).  just fyi, any objections we have  are usually communicated confidentially.  fifth, if you are ging to emphasise mergers, as per your title and opening  paragraph, i question the inclusion of all the discussion on privatisation,  which is good, but does not seem to demonstrate the benefits of merger  activity, which i read is the premise of your speech, per paragraph one.  in  addition, recitation of ownership of miles of gathering lines and  transmission lines does demonstrate change in aggregate ownership, but not  clear it is all due to mergers (e.g., i thin nng is just capital expansion),  nor does the connection get made that this has lead to innovative or enhanced  service offerings.  i do think excellent points can be made about the  deregulation/divestment of gathering, and getting it out of federal  regualtroy purview, but that is not in the speech at this point. sixth, you describe ""network industries"" well, but in the broader context of  your speech, i think your listeners will assume you are referring to the  physical network, rather than the enron vision, which you capture accurately,  nor is it easily understood how this demonstrates or adds to your point about  convergence.   seventh, in your table of converged companies, you could be asked about the  fact that duke has already disposed of the pipeline assets it acquired in the  panenergy deal (since sold to cms), apparently keeping only the trading  business.  also, our pieeline assets to do not serve our cogen facilites in  nj, so not clear to me that thisdemonstrate convergence in the east coast. hope this helps.  i will be travelling today and monday, but if you have  questions, please leave me voice mails, and i will return your calls. ""sectoral"" change. mark",0

"yes, thanks a lot. vince ""conditional value-at-risk for general loss distributions"" document:  available from the ssrn electronic paper collection:  contact:  stanislav p. uryasev   postal:  university of florida  co-auth:  tyrrell r. rockafellar   postal:  university of washington abstract:  fundamental properties of conditional value-at-risk, as a  measure of risk with significant advantages over value-at-risk,  are derived for loss distributions in finance that can involve  discreetness. such distributions are of particular importance in  applications because of the prevalence of models based on  scenarios and finite sampling. conditional value-at-risk is able  to quantify dangers beyond value-at-risk, and moreover it is  coherent. it provides optimization shortcuts which, through  linear programming techniques, make practical many large-scale  calculations that could otherwise be out of reach. the numerical  efficiency and stability of such calculations, shown in several  case studies, are illustrated further with an example of index  tracking.  keywords: value-at-risk, conditional value-at-risk, mean  shortfall, coherent risk measures, risk sampling, scenarios,  hedging, index tracking, portfolio optimization, risk management jel classification: g0 john d. martin carr p. collins chair in finance finance department baylor university",0

"summary of what we discussed the other night: background: power from california to the northwest. the cal gas and power utilities remain unhedged (price caps are in place for  retail power and utilities continue to buy power from the iso and px while  gas utilities, we believe, are primarily buying at spot prices even under  their long term deals).  the power utilities will continue to book large  deferrals and gas utilities will be passing costs through a month or two  after incurring them. the impact of the gas price increases will begin  showing up in jan billings to consumers. utilities will curtail deliveries in the following order:  interruptible  first (with some priority for cogens); firm service (with utilities  alternating or rolling between generation load and nongeneration load); and  core customers last.  curtailment rules apparently allow the utilities to  confiscate gas sold to direct access customers",0
